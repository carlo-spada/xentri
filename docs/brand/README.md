> Brand & Marketing - digital presence, website, content, and lead generation.

The Brand category contains modules for establishing and managing a business's online presence. These modules consume the Universal Brief to auto-populate content and maintain brand consistency.

## Modules

| Module | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| website-builder | AI-powered website generation from Brief | Planned |
| cms | Content management for pages, blog, portfolio | Planned |
| lead-capture | Forms, landing pages, lead routing | Planned |

## Key Concepts

### Brief-Powered Content
Website copy, about pages, and service descriptions are auto-generated from the Universal Brief, ensuring consistency across all touchpoints.

### Lead Capture Flow
```
Visitor → Form → Lead Event → CRM (if enabled) → Notification
```

All lead data flows through the Event Backbone, enabling cross-module intelligence.

## Dependencies

| Depends On | Relationship |
|------------|--------------|
| `platform/core-api` | Authentication, event storage |
| `strategy/universal-brief` | Content auto-population |

## Roadmap

This category is the focus of **Epic 3** in the product roadmap.

*Modules in this category are planned. Documentation will be added as development begins.*
