# Team

> Team & HR - human resources, payroll, and role management.

The Team category contains modules for managing team members, their roles, and HR-related functions.

## Modules

| Module  | Purpose                         | Status  |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| hr      | Employee records and management | Planned |
| payroll | Salary and payment tracking     | Planned |
| roles   | Permission and access control   | Planned |

## Key Concepts

### Role-Based Access

Roles define what team members can see and do across all Xentri modules. Enforced at the platform level via RLS policies.

### Team Events

- `team.member_joined`, `team.member_left`
- `team.role_changed`

## Dependencies

| Depends On          | Relationship                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `platform/core-api` | Authentication, org management |

## Roadmap

This category is planned for future development (Epic 7).

_Modules in this category are planned. Documentation will be added as development begins._
