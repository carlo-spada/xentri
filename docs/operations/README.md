# Operations

> Operations & Projects - project management, tasks, and scheduling.

The Operations category contains modules for managing day-to-day business operations, including project delivery, task management, and team scheduling.

## Modules

| Module | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| projects | Project creation and tracking | Planned |
| tasks | Task management and assignments | Planned |
| calendar | Scheduling and availability | Planned |

## Key Concepts

### Deal-to-Project Flow
```
Deal Won (Sales) → Project Created → Tasks Generated → Delivery
```

### Calm Prompt Integration
- Overdue tasks appear as Open Loops
- Today's scheduled work surfaces in daily view
- Project milestones trigger notifications

## Dependencies

| Depends On | Relationship |
|------------|--------------|
| `platform/core-api` | Authentication, event storage |
| `sales/pipeline` | Deal-to-project conversion (optional) |

## Roadmap

This category is planned for future development.

*Modules in this category are planned. Documentation will be added as development begins.*
