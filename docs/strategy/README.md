# Strategy

> Strategy & Clarity Engine - where business clarity begins.

The Strategy category contains modules that help businesses define their identity, goals, and strategic direction. This is the entry point for new Xentri users - conversation before configuration.

## Modules

| Module           | Purpose                                                     | Status  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| universal-brief  | The "DNA" of a business - generated through AI conversation | Planned |

| war-room         | Strategic dashboard and decision center                     | Planned |

## Key Concepts

### Universal Brief

The Universal Brief is a living document that captures:

- Business identity and values
- Target customers and personas
- Products/services offered
- Competitive positioning
- Goals and success metrics

Once generated, the Brief powers auto-configuration across all other modules.

### Strategy Co-pilot

An AI assistant that:

- Guides users through Brief creation via conversation
- Asks clarifying questions to extract business essence
- Suggests improvements based on industry patterns
- Updates the Brief as the business evolves
