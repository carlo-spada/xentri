# Product Brief: Xentri

**Date:** 2025-11-24
**Author:** Carlo
**Context:** Enterprise Greenfield - Startup/Business Venture

---

## Executive Summary

Xentri is for small and medium businesses that are tired of the chaos.

**The Problem You Know Too Well:** Your business runs on WhatsApp threads, mental notes, and hope. Quotes get lost. Invoices go unsent. You lie awake wondering "Did we follow up with that client?" Your tools don't talk to each other, and you've become the human glue holding it all together.

**What Xentri Does:** It starts as a professional website that captures leads automatically—so you look as good online as your work does in person. From there, it becomes the one place where your business lives: your clients, quotes, jobs, and invoices in one calm workspace.

**How It Works:** You don't start by wrestling forms and settings. You start by talking.

In your first session, you describe your business in your own words. Xentri's AI co-pilot turns that conversation into:
- a working website,
- a basic client/services structure,
- and a simple lead→quote→job→invoice flow.

When a new request comes in—from your website, a message you copy from WhatsApp, or a quick note—you can turn it into a quote or job in a couple of clicks. When you mark a job as done, Xentri reminds you to send the invoice. Later, the same co-pilot proposes new modules (blog, CRM, invoicing, marketing) as your needs grow.

**The Path:** Start with a $10/mo professional website that captures leads ("Presencia"). Add a client list and quote tracking when you're ready (~$30/mo). Grow into invoicing, payment tracking, and a daily "what needs attention" view (~$90/mo). For growing teams, Xentri adds multi-user access, permission controls, and automated reminders (~$270/mo and up). Xentri grows with you—from solo contractor to 20-person operation.

**Who It's For:** Service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, small clinics, restaurants, workshops and similar) who are great at their craft but drowning in paperwork and follow-ups. If you've ever lost a job because you forgot to call someone back, Xentri is for you.

*(Internal framing: In product terms, Xentri is a modular "Business OS" with an event-driven backbone and AI co-pilot—but the customer sees "from your website to your invoices in one calm workspace.")*

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Small and medium business owners live with a constant, low-grade anxiety that "something is dropping." This isn't mainly about missing features – it's about the gap between **what's really happening** and **what they can do about it**.

Over years, every new business problem got solved locally, in the fastest way possible:

- Reply on WhatsApp instead of logging into a CRM.
- Open Excel instead of learning a new tool.
- Ask the spouse to "keep a list" instead of setting up a system.

The result isn't a "bad system" so much as a **business that grew faster than its tools**. What they have today is a patchwork that nobody fully understands or trusts.

This creates three compounding problems:

1. **Fragmented state**
   No single source of truth. Client info lives in WhatsApp, quotes in Excel, invoices in QuickBooks, and critical context in the owner's head.

2. **Manual glue work**
   The owner (or their spouse, or their "ops person") becomes the human router: copy-pasting, re-keying data, chasing threads, reconciling numbers across tools.

3. **Invisible uncertainty**
   Even when automations exist (Zapier rules, CRM triggers), they're opaque, technically hard to use and/or too expensive for S&MBs. The owner can't easily answer: "Did every won deal get invoiced?" They don't fully trust the system, so they keep checking manually anyway.

Most of the time, this is **chronic pain** they've learned to live with. It becomes urgent at specific moments:

- Tax season or month-end, when they realize money is missing or records are a mess.
- Losing a big client because a quote or follow-up slipped.
- A key employee or spouse threatening to quit "doing the admin."

**The emotional job Xentri solves:** turn chronic, background anxiety into a manageable, visible list of responsibilities – especially at those critical trigger moments – so owners and their teams feel caught up instead of constantly behind.

### Problem Impact

**For the Owner:**
- Lost revenue from forgotten follow-ups and unsent invoices (for trades and clinics, often 2–5 jobs/month in missed or delayed work).
- Sleep disruption and mental load ("Did we bill the hotel job?" "Did we answer that clinic inquiry?").
- Inability to step away – the business can't run without them acting as the memory and the router.

**For the Spouse / Admin / "Good With Computers" Person:**
- Being the single point of failure for process knowledge ("Ask María, she's the only one who knows where that is").
- Wasting hours reconciling data instead of improving workflows.
- Getting blamed when something falls through the cracks, even if the system made it almost inevitable.

**For the Client-Facing Team:**
- Embarrassment when follow-ups are missed or invoices are wrong in front of clients.
- Time lost hunting for context before client meetings or site visits.
- Feeling responsible for errors caused by the tools and workflows, not just their own actions.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

The core disconnect: most "unified systems" are designed **database-out** (enterprise schemas, clean funnels, structured forms) instead of **reality-in** (messy conversations, voice notes, side agreements).

They assume:

> "Once you enter clean data, we'll give you a beautiful dashboard."

But for trades and clinics, the messy reality never fully makes it into the system.

| Solution Type | What They Promise | Why They Fail for S&MBs |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Simplified CRMs** (Pipedrive, HubSpot Starter) | "Easy to use" | Still demand structured data entry before providing value. Owners drop off. |
| **Vertical SaaS** (Jobber, Jane, etc.) | "Built for your industry" | Great for logistics, weak on marketing/growth. Often require a separate site. |
| **Website Builders** (Wix, Squarespace) | "All-in-one" | Beautiful brochures, but operationally shallow. No real control of follow-ups, jobs, or money. |
| **All-in-one Platforms** (GoHighLevel, Odoo) | "Everything you need" | Overwhelming complexity. Feel like another job to manage, not a relief. |

On top of that, **WhatsApp gravity** is real: customers live there, so owners live there. Any tool that doesn't integrate with or at least **respect** that behavior tends to be ignored after week two.

**The Data Entry Tax:** Most tools demand structured data (dozens of fields) before giving any value. Xentri reverses this: it delivers value first (a website and basic flows), then gradually asks for more structure as needed.

**Xentri's thesis:**

- Start with something the owner already wants and understands – a professional website that makes them look good and captures leads.
- Then, gradually grow the operational backbone underneath them – one place to see clients, quotes, jobs, invoices – in a way that works *with* their existing habits (WhatsApp, email, notes), not against them.
- Earn trust by catching obvious leaks (lost leads, forgotten invoices) before asking them to move more of their world into Xentri.

### Why Now

Two timing forces make this problem especially sharp:

**1. Rising expectations + inflation pressure**
- Clients expect professional communication, clear quotes, and proper follow-ups even from small trades and clinics.
- At the same time, inflation and rising costs mean **lost jobs and late invoices hurt more** than ever.

**2. The window before incumbents fully "wake up"**
- Website builders (Wix, Squarespace, etc.) are slowly adding CRM and light operations features.
- Vertical tools (Jobber, Jane, etc.) are expanding their marketing features.
- But in most markets, there is still no **simple, website-first "Business OS"** that:
  - speaks the language of trades/clinics,
  - surfaces open loops clearly,
  - and grows with the business instead of overwhelming it on day one.

**3. AI is ready to close the "setup gap"**

The thing that kept owners from adopting business software wasn't missing features—it was the setup burden. AI co-pilots can now scaffold websites, data models, and flows from a conversation, turning a "weekend project" into a "first session."

Xentri's opportunity is to define that category early for service SMEs, then stay ahead as incumbents try to bolt AI setup onto their existing products.

*(Internal note on choice architecture: Entry will have 5 levels for 5+ different business archetypes, plus dozens of add-on modules – but users will only ever see a maximum of 3-5 choices at any given time. New prospects first "decide" which business archetype they fall into, then size/budget. Once they become customers, they can upgrade, downgrade, or choose add-ons – with a maximum of two add-ons shown at any time, shuffled monthly to "feel" for what they actually want. This marketing intelligence will itself be run by another Xentri module. We will be our own first client and pioneer: our public website built with our Website Builder, content managed by our CMS, customers tracked in our CRM, etc.)*

### Proposed Solution

Xentri is a modular, AI-assisted platform that meets small businesses where they are – starting with the thing they already want (a professional website) and using an AI co-pilot to grow into the operational backbone they need.

**The Core Architecture:**

1. **An AI Co-pilot**
   Instead of forcing owners to configure forms and settings, Xentri uses an AI co-pilot that turns natural-language conversations into website structure, data objects, and automations. Describe your business; the co-pilot scaffolds your site, creates your client/services structure, and wires your initial flows. Later, it proposes new modules as your needs grow—without you becoming a systems integrator.

2. **A Unified Shell**
   One calm workspace instead of ten tabs. The sidebar and header are stable anchors; switching between modules (Website, CRM, Invoicing, etc.) feels like changing panels, not switching websites.

3. **A Consistent Data Model**
   Clients, projects, quotes, invoices, and conversations all live on the same schema. When you look at a client, you see everything: their inquiry, their quotes, their jobs, their payments, their messages – without opening five tabs.

4. **An Event-Driven Backbone**
   Everything important is an explicit event: `lead_created`, `quote_sent`, `invoice_issued`, `payment_received`. This powers timelines, audit logs, and the "what needs attention" view. The system can answer: "What happened to this client?" by replaying their event history.

5. **A Visible Automation Layer**
   Every automated action (sending a reminder, creating a follow-up, flagging an overdue invoice) is logged and explainable. Users can see: "Xentri created this follow-up because the quote was sent 3 days ago with no response." No black-box magic.

6. **The "Calm Prompt" / Open Loops View**
   One screen that surfaces what needs attention today: quotes waiting for response, jobs ready to invoice, invoices overdue, leads going cold. Not a to-do list you build – a to-do list the system builds for you based on what's actually happening.

**The Growth Path:**

| Stage | What They Get | What It Replaces |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Presencia** ($10/mo) | Professional website + lead capture | Wix/Squarespace basic site |
| **Light Ops** ($30/mo) | + Client list, quote tracking, basic reminders | Spreadsheet + memory |
| **Business in Motion** ($90/mo) | + Invoicing, payment tracking, Open Loops view | QuickBooks + scattered notes |
| **Professional** ($270/mo) | + Multi-user, permissions, automated reminders | Jobber/Jane + patchwork |
| **Enterprise** ($500+/mo) | + Multi-location, advanced integrations, custom workflows | Full ERP consideration |

Each tier is a complete, usable product – not a crippled version of the next tier.

### Key Differentiators

1. **AI Co-pilot from Day Zero**

   You don’t start with a blank form or a blank template. You start with a
   conversation.

   Describe your business in semi-casual language and Xentri’s AI co-pilot:

   - scaffolds a professional website,
   - creates your basic client + services structure,
   - wires a simple lead→quote→job→invoice flow,
   - and proposes initial reminders/automations.

   Over time, the same co-pilot helps you add new modules (blog, CRM, invoicing,
   marketing flows) without “becoming the IT person.”

2. **Calm, Not Noisy**

   One daily view of what matters. No flood of notifications, no 40-tab cockpit. Xentri shows you the 3–5 things that need attention today and stays quiet the rest of the time.

3. **Website-First, Not CRM-First**

   Most tools start with "manage your pipeline." Xentri starts with "look professional online and capture leads" – something every business already wants. The operational superpowers reveal themselves as you grow.

4. **Visible, Not Magical**

   Every automated action is logged with a clear explanation: "Xentri created this reminder because your quote was sent 3 days ago and hasn't been answered." You can always see what happened and why.

5. **Modular Growth, Not All-or-Nothing**

   Start with a $10 website. Add client tracking when you're ready. Add invoicing when you need it. Xentri grows under your feet without forcing a big bang migration.

6. **Works With Your Existing Habits**

   We don't try to replace WhatsApp. Xentri offers a "Magic Copy" flow: copy a WhatsApp message, paste it into Xentri, and turn it into a lead or quote in a couple of clicks. Forward an email, jot a quick note—Xentri helps you turn those messy inputs into structured leads, quotes and jobs instead of making you retype everything into rigid forms.

## Target Users

### Core Personas (Across All SMEs)

**Primary User – Owner / Founder**

- Expert at their craft, not at running a business.
- Mentally overloaded, skeptical of "AI magic."
- Lives in WhatsApp, email, and a couple of tools; everything else is in their head.
- Needs: one calm view of what matters today, confidence that follow-ups and money flows are not being dropped, and a way to add more structure over time without a big, scary jump.

**Secondary User – Spouse / Admin / "Good With Computers" Person**

- Often the implementer, even if the owner is the formal decision-maker.
- Single point of failure for process knowledge ("Ask María, she knows where that is.").
- Needs: something they can actually learn and maintain, clear visibility into "what happened and why," and tools that make them look organized and competent.

**Tertiary User – Client-Facing Team**

- Project managers, technicians, assistants, reception, etc.
- Stressed by context switching and hunting for information.
- Needs: one client/job view and a clear "what's next" so they don't drop balls or look unprofessional.

These three personas exist in **many types of SMEs**: trades, clinics, agencies, workshops, small shops, training businesses, etc.

### Indirect Stakeholders

**The Accountant (Indirect Stakeholder)**

Miguel's "contador" never logs into Xentri, but they receive its output: invoice exports, expense summaries, tax reports. If Xentri makes the accountant's life easier, they become an unpaid referral channel: "Tell your other clients to use this."

- **What they need:** Clean CSV/Excel exports, compliance with local invoicing requirements (CFDI in Mexico, SII in Spain), clear categorization of income/expenses.
- **v0.3+ feature:** One-click "Tax Pack" export (clean CSV/Excel of clients, invoices, payments) makes accountants more likely to recommend Xentri to their other clients.

**The End Customer (Indirect Stakeholder)**

Miguel's customers never log into Xentri, but they experience every customer-facing output: the website, the quote PDF, the invoice email, the follow-up reminder. Professional, consistent outputs build trust and make Miguel look like a bigger operation than he is.

- **What they need:** Clean, branded quotes and invoices. A professional website. Timely, non-spammy follow-ups.

---

### Initial Beachhead Verticals (Phase 1–2)

We are **not** limiting Xentri to trades and clinics long-term, but we need sharp starting points where:

- The pain is high (lost jobs, forgotten invoices, chaotic follow-ups), and
- The Website → OS wedge is natural.

For v1–v2, we focus on:

| Vertical | Entry Point | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Service Trades** | Website + quote tracking | HVAC, plumbing, electrical, repair, etc. |
| **Small Clinics / Practices** | Website + appointment / inquiry leads | Medical, dental, wellness, therapy, etc. |
| **Workshops / Studios** | Website + job / project tracking | Carpentry, fabrication, creative studios |

**Restaurants & Hospitality:** Deferred for now due to POS / KDS complexity. Likely Phase 3+ once we have stronger integrations and a clearer restaurant-OS story.

**Compliance Consideration:** For English-speaking markets (US, UK, AU), basic PDF invoicing is sufficient for v0.3. For secondary geo expansion (v0.4+), Mexico requires CFDI (electronic invoicing via SAT-authorized PAC) and Spain requires SII compliance. This is a v0.4 requirement for those markets, not blocking for Phase 1–3.

---

### Expansion Thesis: From Verticals to "All SMEs"

Long-term, Xentri's target is **SMEs in general**, not just trades and clinics.

The unifying pattern across SMEs:

> **Request → Work → Money**
> (Lead / Inquiry → Job / Project / Service → Invoice / Payment)

We start with verticals where this pattern is very visible (trades & clinics), then expand to other SME types by:

- Re-using the same **OS core** (Shell, Event Backbone, Calm Prompt),
- Adapting terminology and templates per vertical (e.g., "job" vs "project" vs "case"), and
- Keeping Website → Leads → Jobs → Money as the spine.

Xentri's long-term ambition: become the go-to "calm ops OS" for SMEs across trades, clinics, agencies, workshops, and beyond – starting with a few sharp beachheads, not ending there.

## Success Metrics

### What Success Looks Like

**For the User (Miguel):**
- "I know what needs my attention today without hunting through apps"
- "I haven't lost a quote or forgotten an invoice in months"
- "My spouse/admin isn't drowning in spreadsheets anymore"
- "Clients comment on how professional my quotes and website look"

**For Xentri (the Business):**
- Users who start with a $10 website upgrade to $30+ within 6 months
- Users at $90+ stay for 12+ months (low churn = they actually need it)
- Word-of-mouth referrals drive meaningful portion of new sign-ups
- Accountants start recommending Xentri to their other clients

### Business Objectives

**Phase 1 (v0.1–v0.3): Prove the Wedge**
- Launch Website Builder + CMS + basic lead capture (Presencia tier)
- Achieve first 100 paying users (English-speaking markets)
- Validate that website users want to upgrade to client/quote tracking

**Phase 2 (v0.4–v0.6): Prove the OS**
- Launch invoicing + Open Loops view (Business in Motion tier)
- Achieve first 500 paying users with meaningful tier distribution
- Validate that $90/mo users retain better than $10/mo users (they're getting real value)

**Phase 3 (v0.7+): Scale and Expand**
- Launch multi-user + automated reminders (Professional tier)
- Expand to additional verticals beyond trades/clinics
- Build referral engine (accountants, word-of-mouth, "powered by Xentri")

### Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | What It Tells Us | Target (Phase 1) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Sign-ups** | Top-of-funnel interest | 500+ trials |
| **Activation Rate** | % who complete website setup | >60% |
| **Conversion Rate** | % trials → paid | >10% |
| **Upgrade Rate** | % Presencia → Light Ops+ | >20% within 6mo |
| **Monthly Churn** | % users who cancel | <5% for $30+, <3% for $90+ |
| **NPS** | Would they recommend? | >40 |
| **Referral %** | New users from word-of-mouth | >20% |

### North Star & Success Metrics

#### Primary North Star

**"Weekly Money Events per Organization"**
Number of invoices sent + payments recorded per active organization per week.

This captures the core value: Xentri helps small businesses turn work into money.

If this number is healthy and growing, it means:
- Organizations are moving through the full funnel (Lead / Inquiry → Quote → Job / Service → Invoice → Payment).
- Xentri is being used for real business, not just setup.
- Users are seeing tangible ROI – money is flowing through the system.

#### Supporting Metrics by Tier

Because not every org has invoicing from day one, we track tier-appropriate metrics:

| Tier | Primary Metric | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Presencia** ($10) | Leads captured per week | Website is actually working |
| **Light Ops** ($30) | Quotes created per week | CRM / quote flow is working |
| **Business in Motion** ($90) | Invoices sent per week | Full funnel is working |
| **Professional** ($270) | Money events per org per week | Multi-user ops are working |

These are "local North Stars" that roll up into the global **Weekly Money Events per Organization** metric.

#### Secondary / Health Metric

**Funnel Velocity** – median days from `lead_created` → `invoice_sent`.

- If velocity improves over time, Xentri is making users more efficient at turning interest into income.
- If velocity worsens, something in the flow (UX, features, configuration) is adding friction.

#### Secondary Engagement Metric

**"Open Loops Closed per Week"** measures how often users resolve follow-ups, quotes, and overdue items surfaced by Xentri. We expect this to correlate strongly with perceived "peace of mind," but our primary North Star remains the flow of money events.

This remains a *supporting engagement metric*, not the primary North Star—it tells us the Calm Prompt is being used, but doesn't directly measure business value.

## MVP Scope

### What "MVP" Means for Xentri

Xentri's MVP is not one product—it's a **tiered release** where each tier is a complete, usable product:

- Cross-business intelligence ("businesses like yours do X")
- Vertical-specific modules (clinic EMR, restaurant POS integration)
- White-label / reseller program

### Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **AI onboarding quality** (v0.1) | Medium-High | High | Constrain scope: scaffold website + basic structure, not full automation. Fall back to templates gracefully if AI fails. |
| **Low upgrade rate** (v0.1→v0.2) | Medium-High | High | Build upgrade prompts into Presencia ("5 new leads—want to track them?"); AI co-pilot suggests upgrades based on usage patterns |
| **Website builder scope creep** | High | Medium | Evaluate GrapesJS/Craft.js instead of building from scratch; launch with 3 quality templates, not 10 mediocre ones |
| **Wix/Squarespace AI catch-up** | Medium | Medium-High | Differentiate on structure generation (flows + data), not content generation (pages + copy) |
| **CFDI complexity** (v0.4 secondary geo) | High | Medium | Start PAC research in v0.2 phase; don't block English-speaking market launch on compliance |
| **Multi-tenant data leaks** | Low | Critical | Paranoid testing; every query includes `org_id`; row-level security in Postgres; code review checklist |

## Market Context

### Category Reality

"Business OS" is useful internally—it describes what we're building. But Miguel doesn't search for "Business OS." He searches for "small business website" or "invoice software for contractors."

**Positioning ladder:**
- **Acquisition**: "From your website to your invoices" (tangible, searchable)
- **Retention**: "Everything in one calm workspace" (value realization)
- **Internal/Investor**: "The Business OS" (mental model, category creation)

### Geographic Focus

Xentri is an **English-first** application.

- **Primary (Phase 1–2):** English-speaking SMEs in the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and other markets where English is the default for business tools.

- **Secondary (Phase 2+):** Spanish-speaking markets (Mexico, Spain, LatAm), where we can go deeper on local invoicing and compliance (e.g., CFDI in Mexico, SII in Spain).

- **Later expansion (Phase 3+):** German, French, Italian, and Portuguese markets, once the core product and vertical playbooks are mature.

Compliance notes (CFDI, SII, etc.) still matter, but they're part of the **secondary** geo thesis, not the primary story.

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Right to Win (AI Angle) |
|------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Wix / Squarespace** | Best-in-class design, AI copy/image helpers | They generate pages; we generate flows + data + automations. |
| **Jobber / Jane** | Deep vertical ops, scheduling, mobile | They expect you to configure; we scaffold via conversation. |
| **GoHighLevel** | Powerful marketing automation, agency focus | They assume an expert admin; we assume a busy owner + AI co-pilot. |
| **Odoo** | Huge module ecosystem, ERP depth | They require consultants; we start with a guided chat. |
| **HubSpot Starter** | Great UX, strong brand | Marketing-first, not ops-first; expensive at scale. |

**The AI Differentiator (Honest):**

We're not claiming "no one does AI." Wix has AI page generation; HubSpot has AI writing. What we claim:
- They use AI to generate **content** (pages, copy, images).
- We use AI to generate **structure** (data models, flows, automations).

That's a meaningful difference for someone who doesn't just need a prettier website—they need their business to run.

### Pricing Validation

From market research, Xentri's pricing ladder is competitive:

| Tier | Xentri | Competitor Benchmark | Verdict |
|------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| **Presencia** ($10/mo) | Website + lead capture | Wix $17/mo, Squarespace $16/mo | **Aggressive** — undercuts incumbents |
| **Light Ops** ($30/mo) | + CRM + quotes | Jobber $39/mo, Jane $54/mo, Clio $39/mo | **Sweet spot** — undercuts vertical SaaS significantly |
| **Business in Motion** ($90/mo) | + Invoicing + Open Loops | Jobber $119/mo, Toast $110/mo | **Competitive** — offers "OS" value at mid-tier price |
| **Professional** ($270/mo) | + Multi-user + automations | GoHighLevel $297/mo, Jobber $199/mo | **Aligned** — matches "Pro" tiers of major players |

**Pricing Reality:** Our pricing isn't revolutionary—it's honest. The real value is bundled savings: "Cancel your Mailchimp ($13) + Calendly ($10) + basic CRM ($15) → save $38/mo by consolidating into Xentri."

### Strategic Threats

**Threat 1: Website Builders Adding Ops + AI**

Wix and Squarespace are moving from "Site Builders" to "Business Solutions":
- Wix: Built-in CRM, invoicing, automations, AI copy generation
- Squarespace: "Projects" hub, invoicing, scheduling (Acuity)

**Xentri's defense:** They use AI to generate **pages and content**, not **business structure and flows**. They're marketing-centric, not operations-centric. They lack multi-step workflow logic, service-specific flows, and deep invoicing. Focus on the "messy middle" of operations.

**Threat 2: Vertical SaaS Adding AI Setup**

Jobber and Jane could add AI-powered setup or website builders.

**Xentri's defense:** Website-first positioning means we capture users before they need ops. Vertical SaaS would be bolting on AI setup to existing users; we're capturing new users at the "I need a website" stage and growing them. Also: our AI is core to the experience, not a bolt-on.

**Threat 3: WhatsApp / Meta Business Suite**

Meta is expanding WhatsApp Business features (catalogs, payments, CRM-like features).

**Xentri's defense:** WhatsApp is a channel, not an OS. Xentri works WITH WhatsApp (copy messages, send notifications) rather than trying to replace it. If Meta builds a full Business OS, everyone has a problem—but it's unlikely they'll go that deep into operations.

### Market Timing

**Why now:**

1. **AI expectation shift** — Users now expect software to be "smart." AI-assisted setup isn't a gimmick anymore; it's table stakes. Xentri's conversational onboarding fits the moment.

2. **Post-COVID digital acceleration** — SMBs that resisted going digital are now forced to. The "I don't need a website" holdouts are shrinking.

3. **Inflation pressure** — Lost jobs and late invoices hurt more. The ROI of "not dropping balls" is higher than ever.

4. **English-first market depth** — The US/UK/AU SMB market is massive and underserved by "calm" tools. Most all-in-ones are overwhelming; most simple tools are shallow.

## Technical Preferences

### Philosophy

**"Decoupled Unity"** — The user sees one calm workspace; under the hood, each capability (Website, CRM, Invoicing) is an independent module that can be built, deployed, and scaled separately.

**"Event Backbone as Source of Truth"** — Every business action is an explicit event. This enables audit trails, "what happened" timelines, and the Open Loops view without complex queries or manual tracking.

**"AI as Infrastructure, Not Magic"** — The AI co-pilot is a scaffolding tool that generates structure (websites, data models, flows), not a black box that "handles everything." Users can always see and override what the AI proposes.

### Stack Direction (Not Locked)

These are strong preferences, not mandates. Final decisions belong to the architecture phase.

| Layer | Preference | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| **Frontend Shell** | Astro + React Islands | SSR for fast initial load; React for rich interactivity; lazy-load modules to keep shell light |
| **Backend Services** | Node.js (TypeScript) for most; Python for AI/ML | Type safety across the stack; Python ecosystem for LLM work |
| **Database** | Postgres (single cluster, schema-per-service) | Mature, reliable, excellent JSON support for events; RLS for multi-tenancy |
| **Event Transport** | Redis Streams → n8n | Fast internal sync; n8n for visible, editable business logic |
| **AI Layer** | OpenAI API (or compatible) | Best-in-class for conversational scaffolding; can swap providers later |

### Non-Negotiables

1. **Multi-tenant from day zero** — Every table has `org_id`; Row-Level Security enforced in Postgres; no shortcuts.

2. **Event-first data model** — All significant actions write to `system_events` before updating domain tables. This is the audit trail and the basis for Open Loops.

3. **Visible automations** — Every automated action (AI-generated, workflow-triggered, or scheduled) is logged with a human-readable explanation. No black boxes.

4. **Modular frontend** — Switching between Website Builder, CRM, and Invoicing should feel like changing panels, not loading a new app. Shared shell, lazy-loaded modules.

5. **API-first backend** — Every capability is accessible via API. The frontend is just one client; future mobile apps, integrations, and the AI co-pilot are others.

### AI Co-pilot Technical Constraints

The AI co-pilot is a core differentiator, but it must be constrained to be reliable:

| Constraint | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| **Scaffolding, not generation** | AI proposes website structure + data model; user confirms. AI doesn't publish directly. |
| **Graceful fallback** | If AI fails or user opts out, they land on a template picker—never a blank screen. |
| **Logged proposals** | Every AI suggestion is logged as an event (`ai_proposal_generated`), so we can audit and improve. |
| **No hallucinated data** | AI can structure user input; it cannot invent clients, invoices, or business data. |

### Golden Path Templates

For each target vertical (trades, clinics, workshops), Xentri maintains opinionated "golden path" setups: pre-configured services, website structure, and basic flows that represent the most common patterns for that business type.

The AI co-pilot begins from the conversation, but if the conversation is short, messy, or low-confidence, it snaps to the closest golden path so the user never sees a blank canvas. AI scaffolding + golden paths together avoid the "getting stuck" cliff during setup.

**Example:** A plumber who types "I do water heaters and drain cleaning" gets snapped to the Trades golden path with those two services pre-filled—not a blank website builder.

### Performance Targets (v0.1)

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Initial load (shell)** | <2s on 3G | First impression; many SMB owners on mobile/slow connections |
| **Time to first website preview** | <5 min from sign-up | AI onboarding must feel fast |
| **Module switch** | <500ms | Feels like changing tabs, not loading a new app |
| **Event write latency** | <100ms | Every action should feel instant |

### What We Won't Build (Technical)

- **Custom email infrastructure** — Use transactional email provider (Resend, Postmark, etc.)
- **Custom auth** — Use Supabase Auth or similar; don't roll our own
- **Custom PDF rendering** — Use proven library (PDFKit, Puppeteer, etc.)
- **Custom payment processing** — Integrate Stripe, not build our own gateway

### The Eject Button (Data Portability)

From day one, users can export all core business data (clients, jobs, invoices, payments) to clean CSV/Excel. Xentri should feel like a trustworthy steward of data, not a trap; easy export is a deliberate design choice to reduce "lock-in" anxiety.

This also supports the "Tax Pack" export for accountants and builds trust with skeptical owners who've been burned by tools that held their data hostage.

## Risks and Assumptions

### Key Assumptions

These are beliefs we're treating as true. If any prove false, the strategy may need to change.

| Assumption | Why We Believe It | How We'll Validate |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **SMB owners want "calm," not "powerful"** | Research shows anxiety about complexity; competitors are overwhelming | Early user interviews; track NPS on "ease of use" |
| **Website is a natural entry point** | Every business wants to look professional online; lower commitment than "CRM signup" | Track Presencia → Light Ops upgrade rate |
| **AI onboarding reduces setup friction** | Conversational setup is faster than forms; users expect AI in 2025 | Track time-to-first-website-preview; compare AI vs template path |
| **Upgrade path is natural, not forced** | Users who see value at $10 will want more; not just churn | Track upgrade rate by usage patterns (leads captured, logins/week) |
| **English-speaking markets are sufficient for Phase 1** | US/UK/AU SMB market is massive; simpler compliance | Revenue and user growth in Phase 1 |

### Known Risks

Detailed risk analysis is in the MVP Scope section. Summary:

| Risk | Severity | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| AI onboarding quality | High | Active mitigation: constrained scope, graceful fallback |
| Low upgrade rate | High | Active mitigation: AI-driven upsell prompts, usage-based triggers |
| Wix/Squarespace AI catch-up | Medium-High | Active mitigation: differentiate on structure, not content |
| Website builder scope creep | Medium | Active mitigation: evaluate existing libraries (GrapesJS), limit templates |
| CFDI complexity | Medium | Deferred to v0.4 (secondary geo) |
| Multi-tenant data leaks | Critical | Active mitigation: RLS, code review checklist, paranoid testing |

### Open Questions

These need answers before or during implementation:

1. **AI provider lock-in**: Should we abstract the AI layer to swap providers, or optimize for OpenAI? (Trade-off: flexibility vs speed)

2. **Template library**: Build templates in-house or partner/license? How many templates for v0.1 launch?

3. **Mobile-first or desktop-first**: SMB owners often work on phones, but complex editing (quotes, invoices) may need desktop. What's the priority for v0.1?

4. **Pricing experiments**: Is $10 the right entry point, or should we test $0 (freemium) to $15?

5. **Vertical focus vs horizontal**: Do we launch with vertical-specific templates (trades, clinics) or generic templates first?

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Owner | Risk if Delayed |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Supabase/Auth provider** | External | Blocks all development |
| **AI API access** | External (OpenAI) | Blocks AI onboarding; fallback to templates |
| **Domain provider integration** | External | Blocks custom domain feature |
| **Transactional email provider** | External | Blocks lead notifications, invoice emails |
| **PDF library selection** | Internal | Blocks quote/invoice generation |
