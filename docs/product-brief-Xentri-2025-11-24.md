# Product Brief: Xentri

**Date:** 2025-11-24
**Author:** Carlo
**Context:** Enterprise Greenfield - Startup/Business Venture

---

## Executive Summary

**Xentri is for anyone building or running a business who's tired of the chaos.**

**The Problem You Know Too Well:** Your business runs on WhatsApp threads, mental notes, and hope. Quotes get lost. Invoices go unsent. You lie awake wondering "Did we follow up with that client?" Your tools don't talk to each other, and you've become the human glue holding it all together.

**What Xentri Does:** It starts with a conversation. Before you configure anything, Xentri's free AI co-pilot helps you clarify what your business actually is — your services, your customers, your goals, how work flows. That clarity becomes a living brief that powers everything else: a professional website, a client list, quotes, invoices, and a daily view of what needs your attention.

**How It Works:** You sign up and talk to Xentri. No forms. No settings. The co-pilot asks the right questions and turns your answers into a Universal Brief — the DNA of your business. From there, Xentri recommends the exact modules you need based on your situation. Not a catalog of 100 features. Just 3-5 tools that solve your specific pain, right now.

**The Path:** Start free with the Strategy Co-pilot and build your brief. When you're ready, subscribe to a personalized bundle:
- **Presencia** (~$10/mo): 3 modules tailored to your entry point — whether that's a website, a client list, or a goal tracker.
- **Light Ops** (~$30/mo): 8 modules to run your daily operations — quotes, follow-ups, leads.
- **Business in Motion** (~$90/mo): ~24 modules plus multi-user access — invoicing, payments, team coordination.
- **Professional** (~$270/mo): ~72 modules for growing teams — roles, permissions, advanced workflows.

Each tier is a curated bundle based on your brief, not a one-size-fits-all feature list. You can also add individual modules à la carte at $5/month each.

**Who It's For:** Service businesses (trades, clinics, workshops), founders turning ideas into companies, agencies managing clients, creators building audiences. If you've ever felt like your business grew faster than your systems — Xentri is for you.

*(Internal framing: Xentri is a modular Business OS with an event-driven backbone, 7 capability categories, and AI co-pilots per domain. The customer sees "one calm workspace that grows with you.")*

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**Anyone building or running a business** lives with a constant, low-grade anxiety that "something is dropping." This isn't mainly about missing features – it's about the gap between **what's really happening** and **what they can do about it**.

Over years, every new business problem got solved locally, in the fastest way possible:

- Reply on WhatsApp instead of logging into a CRM.
- Open Excel instead of learning a new tool.
- Ask the spouse to "keep a list" instead of setting up a system.

The result isn't a "bad system" so much as a **business that grew faster than its tools**. What they have today is a patchwork that nobody fully understands or trusts.

This creates three compounding problems:

1. **Fragmented state**
   No single source of truth. Client info lives in WhatsApp, quotes in Excel, invoices in QuickBooks, and critical context in the owner's head.

2. **Manual glue work**
   The owner (or their spouse, or their "ops person") becomes the human router: copy-pasting, re-keying data, chasing threads, reconciling numbers across tools.

3. **Invisible uncertainty**
   Even when automations exist (Zapier rules, CRM triggers), they're opaque, technically hard to use and/or too expensive for S&MBs. The owner can't easily answer: "Did every won deal get invoiced?" They don't fully trust the system, so they keep checking manually anyway.

Most of the time, this is **chronic pain** they've learned to live with. It becomes urgent at specific moments:

- Tax season or month-end, when they realize money is missing or records are a mess.
- Losing a big client because a quote or follow-up slipped.
- A key employee or spouse threatening to quit "doing the admin."

**The emotional job Xentri solves:** turn chronic, background anxiety into a manageable, visible list of responsibilities – especially at those critical trigger moments – so owners and their teams feel caught up instead of constantly behind.

### Problem Impact

The pain manifests differently depending on where you are in your journey, but the root is the same: **the business exists in your head, and that doesn't scale.**

**For the Founder (Pre-Revenue / Early Stage):**
- Ideas, research, and half-formed plans scattered across notes apps, voice memos, browser tabs, and 3am text messages to yourself.
- The inability to articulate what the business actually *is* — to investors, partners, co-founders, or even yourself.
- Spending more energy on "figuring out how to organize" than on building.
- The terrifying gap between vision and execution: you can see where you want to go, but there's no bridge from idea to action.
- Every conversation about the business requires re-explaining from scratch because nothing is written down in a way that's shareable.

**For the Owner (Established, Revenue-Generating):**
- Lost revenue from forgotten follow-ups and unsent invoices — for trades and clinics, often 2–5 jobs/month in missed or delayed work.
- Sleep disruption and mental load: "Did we bill the hotel job?" "Did we answer that clinic inquiry?"
- Inability to step away — the business can't run without you acting as the memory and the router.
- The nagging sense that you're leaving money on the table, but no visibility into where or how much.

**For the Spouse / Admin / "Good With Computers" Person:**
- Being the single point of failure for process knowledge ("Ask María, she's the only one who knows where that is").
- Hours wasted reconciling data across tools instead of improving how things work.
- Getting blamed when something falls through the cracks — even when the system made failure almost inevitable.
- The exhaustion of holding someone else's business together with spreadsheets and willpower.

**For the Client-Facing Team:**
- Embarrassment when follow-ups are missed or invoices are wrong in front of clients.
- Time lost hunting for context before meetings or site visits.
- Feeling responsible for errors caused by broken tools and missing workflows, not their own competence.
- The frustration of knowing things could be better, but having no authority to fix the systems.

---

**The common thread:** At every stage, from first idea to 20-person team, the pain is about **the gap between what's happening and what you can see, trust, and act on.** Xentri closes that gap — starting wherever you are.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

The core disconnect: most "unified systems" are designed **database-out** (enterprise schemas, clean funnels, structured forms) instead of **reality-in** (messy conversations, voice notes, half-formed ideas, side agreements).

They assume:

> "Once you enter clean data, we'll give you a beautiful dashboard."

But the messy reality never fully makes it into the system — whether you're a plumber juggling WhatsApp threads or a founder drowning in Notion pages.

| Solution Type | What They Promise | Why They Fail |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Simplified CRMs** (Pipedrive, HubSpot Starter) | "Easy to use" | Still demand structured data entry before providing value. Owners drop off. |
| **Vertical SaaS** (Jobber, Jane, etc.) | "Built for your industry" | Great for logistics, weak on marketing/growth. Often require a separate website. Don't help you *clarify* the business, just run it. |
| **Website Builders** (Wix, Squarespace) | "All-in-one" | Beautiful brochures, but operationally shallow. No real control over follow-ups, jobs, or money. |
| **All-in-one Platforms** (GoHighLevel, Odoo) | "Everything you need" | Overwhelming complexity. Feel like another job to manage, not a relief. |
| **Founder Tools** (Notion, Linear, Docs + Sheets) | "Flexible workspace" | Infinite flexibility = infinite setup. You spend more time organizing the system than using it. No guidance, no structure, no co-pilot. |
| **AI Assistants** (ChatGPT, generic co-pilots) | "Ask me anything" | Helpful in the moment, but nothing persists. No memory of your business. Every conversation starts from zero. |

On top of that, **WhatsApp gravity** is real: customers and ideas live there, so you live there. Any tool that doesn't integrate with or at least *respect* that behavior tends to be ignored after week two.

**The Data Entry Tax:** Most tools demand structured data (dozens of fields) before giving any value. Xentri reverses this: it delivers value first (clarity, then tools), and gradually asks for more structure as needed.

**Xentri's thesis:**

- Start with a free AI co-pilot that helps you articulate your business — not forms and settings, but a conversation that produces a living brief.
- From that brief, recommend the exact modules you need based on your situation — not a catalog, not a fixed tier, but a curated set of tools that solve your pain right now.
- Earn trust by delivering clarity and catching obvious leaks (scattered ideas, lost leads, forgotten invoices) before asking you to move more of your world into Xentri.
- Grow the operational backbone underneath you — one module at a time — in a way that works *with* your existing habits (WhatsApp, email, voice notes), not against them.

### Why Now

Three timing forces make this problem especially sharp — and this solution especially possible:

**1. Rising expectations + inflation pressure**

Clients expect professional communication, clear quotes, and proper follow-ups — even from a one-person plumbing business or a first-time founder. At the same time, inflation and rising costs mean **every lost job, late invoice, or scattered idea hurts more** than ever. The margin for chaos is shrinking.

**2. The window before incumbents fully "wake up"**

- Website builders (Wix, Squarespace) are slowly adding CRM and light operations features.
- Vertical tools (Jobber, Jane) are expanding their marketing and onboarding.
- Founder tools (Notion, Linear) are adding AI features.

But none of them have built a **co-pilot-first Business OS** that:
- starts with clarity (not configuration),
- speaks to both founders and service businesses,
- surfaces what needs attention without overwhelming,
- and grows modularly instead of forcing a big-bang migration.

The category is forming. The seat is open.

**3. AI has crossed the threshold**

The thing that kept people from adopting business software wasn't missing features — it was the **setup burden**. AI co-pilots can now:
- Turn a messy conversation into a structured brief
- Scaffold data models, workflows, and even websites from natural language
- Recommend what to do next based on context, not just keywords

This isn't "AI as feature." This is AI as the **entry point** — the thing that makes the first 10 minutes delightful instead of daunting. Xentri is built around this from day one, not bolting it on later.

**4. We are our own first client**

Xentri is being built *on* Xentri. Every module we ship has been tested by running our own startup with it. This isn't just dogfooding for QA — it's **existence proof**. If Xentri can help a software company go from idea to revenue, it can help a plumber go from chaos to calm.

This gives us an unfair advantage: we feel the pain daily, we know what's missing, and we ship what we actually need — not what a product committee imagines users want.

*(Internal note on choice architecture: Users will only ever see a maximum of 3-5 module recommendations at any given time. New prospects first complete their Universal Brief, then receive personalized bundle recommendations. Once they become customers, they can upgrade, downgrade, or add modules à la carte — with recommendations shuffled monthly based on usage patterns. This recommendation intelligence is itself powered by Xentri modules. We are Client Zero: our public website built with our Website Builder, content managed by our CMS, customers tracked in our CRM, goals tracked in our Strategy module.)*

### Proposed Solution

Xentri is a modular Business OS that meets you where you are — whether you're a founder with an idea, a plumber with too many WhatsApp threads, or a growing team that's outpaced its spreadsheets.

It starts with a conversation, not a configuration screen.

**The Core Architecture:**

**1. A Free Strategy Co-pilot (The Entry Point)**

Everyone starts here — no credit card required. The Strategy Co-pilot guides you through a conversation that produces your **Universal Brief**: the living DNA of your business. Who you serve, what you offer, how work flows, what success looks like.

This isn't onboarding busywork. The Brief becomes the source of truth that powers everything else — your website, your CRM, your recommendations, your "what needs attention" view.

**2. Seven Capability Categories**

Xentri organizes everything a business needs into seven domains:

| Category | What It Covers |
|----------|----------------|
| **Management & Strategy** | Brief, goals, dashboard, decisions, idea capture |
| **Brand & Marketing** | Website, content, campaigns, reputation |
| **Sales & Pipeline** | Leads, CRM, quotes, pipeline, follow-ups |
| **Finance & Accounting** | Invoicing, payments, expenses, reporting |
| **Operations & Delivery** | Jobs, projects, scheduling, fulfillment |
| **Team & Leadership** | Roles, permissions, SOPs, knowledge base |
| **Legal & Compliance** | Contracts, licenses, policies, compliance tracking |

Each category has its own **specialized co-pilot** that unlocks when you subscribe to modules in that domain. The Strategy Co-pilot orchestrates across all of them.

**3. The Shell + SPA + Module Architecture**

- **The Shell (Astro):** A stable container — header and sidebar never blink. Categories live in the sidebar; only one expands at a time.
- **Subcategories (React SPAs):** Each category contains up to 10 subcategories (e.g., "The War Room," "The North Star"). Each is a self-contained micro-app.
- **Modules (Tabs within SPAs):** Each SPA has up to 10 modules as tabs. Each module is powered by one or more backend microservices.

The user sees a calm, flat interface. Under the hood, it's a composable system that can scale to hundreds of capabilities without overwhelming anyone.

**4. A Consistent Data Model**

Clients, projects, quotes, invoices, and conversations all live on the same schema. When you look at a client, you see everything: their inquiry, their quotes, their jobs, their payments, their messages — without opening five tabs.

**5. An Event-Driven Backbone**

Everything important is an explicit event: `brief_created`, `lead_captured`, `quote_sent`, `invoice_paid`, `decision_logged`. This powers:
- Timelines ("What happened with this client?")
- Audit trails ("Why did this reminder fire?")
- The Calm Prompt ("What needs attention today?")
- Cross-module intelligence ("You've sent 10 quotes but no invoices — ready to add invoicing?")

**6. Visible, Not Magical**

Every automated action — AI-generated, workflow-triggered, or scheduled — is logged with a human-readable explanation. "Xentri created this reminder because your quote was sent 3 days ago and hasn't been answered." No black boxes. You can always see what happened and why.

**7. The Calm Prompt (Open Loops View)**

One screen that surfaces what needs attention today — across all your subscribed modules. Not a to-do list you build, but a to-do list the system builds for you based on what's actually happening. Quotes awaiting response. Invoices overdue. Ideas aging in the inbox. Leads going cold.

**The Growth Path:**

| Tier | Price | Modules | What You Get |
|------|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0/mo | 1 | Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief |
| **Presencia** | $10/mo | 3 | Personalized starter bundle |
| **Light Ops** | $30/mo | 8 | Daily operations bundle |
| **Business in Motion** | $90/mo | ~24 | Full OS + multi-user |
| **Professional** | $270/mo | ~72 | Scaled team + advanced features |
| **Enterprise** | $500+/mo | 135+ | Custom + dedicated support |

Bundles are **personalized based on your Universal Brief** — not a fixed feature list. A plumber's Presencia looks different from a founder's. You can also add any module à la carte at **$5/month** each.

Each tier is a complete, usable product — not a crippled version of the next tier.

### Key Differentiators

**1. Free Strategy Co-pilot from Day Zero**

You don't start with a blank form or a template picker. You start with a conversation — free, no credit card required.

The Strategy Co-pilot asks the right questions and turns your answers into a Universal Brief: the living DNA of your business. That brief indirectly powers everything else — your website, your CRM, your recommendations. Later, category-specific co-pilots unlock as you subscribe to modules in each domain.

**2. Clarity-First, Not Tool-First**

Most tools start with "here's a CRM" or "here's a website builder." Xentri starts with "let's get clear on what your business actually is."

The Universal Brief isn't just onboarding — it's the foundation. Your website pulls from it. Your CRM structures around it. Your recommendations are based on it. Clarity first, tools second.

**3. Calm, Not Noisy**

One daily view of what matters. No flood of notifications, no 40-tab cockpit. Xentri shows you the 3–5 things that need attention today and stays quiet the rest of the time.

**4. Visible, Not Magical**

Every automated action is logged with a clear explanation: "Xentri created this reminder because your quote was sent 3 days ago and hasn't been answered." You can always see what happened and why. No black boxes.

**5. Modular Growth, Not All-or-Nothing**

Start free with the Strategy Co-pilot. Add a $10 starter bundle when you're ready. Grow to $30, $90, $270 as your needs expand. Add individual modules à la carte at $5 each.

Xentri grows under your feet without forcing a big-bang migration. You're never paying for features you don't use, you never even have to see or deal with modules you don't use.

**6. Personalized Bundles, Not Fixed Tiers**

Your Presencia bundle isn't the same as everyone else's. A plumber gets website + lead capture + service catalog. A founder gets brief + goals + roadmap. The AI reads your Universal Brief and curates bundles of modules for your specific situation — not a one-size-fits-all feature list.

**7. Works With Your Existing Habits**

We don't try to replace your WhatsApp, email, or notes app. Xentri offers a "Magic Copy" flow: copy a WhatsApp message, paste it into Xentri, and turn it into a lead or quote in a couple of clicks, later connect your whatsapp directly to Xentri and see this magic happen automatically. Forward an email, jot a quick note — Xentri helps you turn messy inputs into structured data instead of making you retype everything into rigid forms.

**8. We Are Client Zero**

Xentri is built on Xentri. Our website runs on our Website Builder. Our customers are tracked in our CRM. Our goals live in our Strategy module. We ship modules that have been tested by running our own startups with them.

This isn't just dogfooding — it's existence proof. If Xentri can run a software company, it can run a plumbing business.

## Target Users

### Core Personas

**Primary User A – The Founder (Building a Business)**

- Has an idea, a side project, or an early-stage company.
- Drowning in ideas, research, and half-formed plans — scattered across Notion, notes apps, and their head.
- Skeptical of "AI magic" but desperate for something that actually helps them think clearly.
- Needs: a way to articulate the business, capture ideas without losing them, track decisions, and bridge the gap from vision to execution.

**Primary User B – The Owner (Running a Business)**

- Expert at their craft, not at running a business.
- Mentally overloaded; lives in WhatsApp, email, and a couple of tools.
- The business runs on memory, hope, and duct tape.
- Needs: one calm view of what matters today, confidence that follow-ups and money flows aren't being dropped, and a way to add structure without a big scary migration.

**Secondary User – Spouse / Admin / "Good With Computers" Person**

- Often the implementer, even if the owner/founder is the formal decision-maker.
- Single point of failure for process knowledge ("Ask María, she knows where that is").
- Needs: something they can actually learn and maintain, clear visibility into "what happened and why," and tools that make them look organized and competent.

**Tertiary User – Category Specialists (At Scale)**

- Accountants, marketing specialists, operations managers, HR leads, legal counsel, etc.
- At higher tiers, these professionals take ownership of specific Xentri categories.
- Needs: focused access to their domain, ability to work independently without navigating the whole system, clear boundaries and permissions.

**Quaternary User – Client-Facing Team**

- Project managers, technicians, assistants, reception, etc.
- Stressed by context switching and hunting for information.
- Needs: one client/job view and a clear "what's next" so they don't drop balls or look unprofessional.

These personas exist across **many types of businesses**: startups, trades, clinics, agencies, workshops, creators, and more.

### The Team Growth Model

As businesses grow, the number of people using Xentri grows — and the structure naturally evolves toward specialization by category.

| Tier | Typical Team Structure | Who Runs What |
|------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Free** | Solo | Founder/Owner runs Strategy Co-pilot |
| **Presencia** ($10) | Solo | Owner runs 1-2 categories |
| **Light Ops** ($30) | Solo or +1 | Owner + maybe spouse/admin across 2-3 categories |
| **Business in Motion** ($90) | 2-5 people | Owner focuses on Strategy; dedicated personnel start owning specific categories (e.g., bookkeeper on Finance, assistant on Sales) |
| **Professional** ($270) | 5-15 people | Specialists own categories: accountant (Finance), marketer (Brand), ops manager (Operations), etc. Owner primarily on Strategy. |
| **Enterprise** ($500+) | 15+ people | Full specialization — one or more professionals per category, owner as CEO/strategist |

**This is incentivized, not mandated.** An owner can run everything themselves at any tier. But as module count grows (8 → 24 → 72 → 135+), it becomes unsustainable for one person. The system naturally encourages delegation by making it easy to:
- Invite team members with category-specific access
- Assign ownership of modules to specific people
- See who's responsible for what in the Calm Prompt

---

### Stakeholders (Direct & Indirect)

**The Accountant**

- **At lower tiers:** Indirect stakeholder — receives exports (invoice CSVs, Tax Pack), never logs in.
- **At Business in Motion+:** Direct user — logs into Xentri to manage Finance & Accounting modules (invoicing, expenses, payment tracking, reporting).
- **What they need:** Clean data, compliance with local requirements (CFDI, SII), one-click exports, clear categorization.
- **Why this matters:** If Xentri makes accountants' lives easier, they become a referral channel: "Tell your other clients to use this."

**Other Category Specialists**

- **Marketing Specialist:** Manages Brand & Marketing — website updates, campaigns, content, reputation.
- **Operations Manager:** Manages Operations & Delivery — jobs, projects, scheduling, fulfillment.
- **HR / Office Manager:** Manages Team & Leadership — roles, SOPs, onboarding, knowledge base.
- **Legal Counsel:** Manages Legal & Compliance — contracts, licenses, policies (likely part-time or external).

Each specialist gets focused access to their category without needing to navigate the entire system.

**The End Customer (Indirect Stakeholder)**

The end customer never logs into Xentri, but they experience every customer-facing output: the website, the quote PDF, the invoice email, the follow-up reminder. Professional, consistent outputs build trust and make the business look like a bigger operation than it is.

- **What they need:** Clean, branded quotes and invoices. A professional website. Timely, non-spammy follow-ups.

---

### Initial Beachhead Segments (Phase 1–2)

We focus on segments where:
- The pain is high (chaos, lost jobs, scattered ideas)
- The Brief → Modules wedge is natural
- We can validate quickly

| Segment | Entry Point | Example Users |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Founders / Early-Stage** | Universal Brief + Goals + Roadmap | Solo founders, side projects, pre-revenue startups |
| **Service Trades** | Website + Lead Capture + Quotes | HVAC, plumbing, electrical, repair |
| **Small Clinics / Practices** | Website + Appointment Leads + Client List | Medical, dental, wellness, therapy |
| **Workshops / Studios** | Website + Job/Project Tracking | Carpentry, fabrication, creative studios |

**Restaurants & Hospitality:** Deferred for now due to POS/KDS complexity. Likely Phase 3+ once we have stronger integrations.

**Agencies & Creators:** Natural expansion once core modules are proven. They need Brief + CRM + Projects + Invoicing — all in the roadmap.

**Compliance Consideration:** For English-speaking markets (US, UK, AU), basic PDF invoicing is sufficient for v0.3. For secondary geo expansion (v0.4+), Mexico requires CFDI (electronic invoicing via SAT-authorized PAC) and Spain requires SII compliance. This is a v0.4 requirement for those markets, not blocking for Phase 1–3.

---

### Expansion Thesis: From Segments to "All Businesses"

Long-term, Xentri's target is **anyone building or running a business**, not just trades and clinics.

The unifying pattern:

> **Idea → Clarity → Action → Money**
> (Brief → Modules → Work → Revenue)

We start with segments where this pattern is visible and painful (founders, trades, clinics), then expand to other business types by:

- Re-using the same **OS core** (Shell, Event Backbone, Calm Prompt, Co-pilots)
- Adapting terminology and templates per segment (e.g., "job" vs "project" vs "case" vs "gig")
- Keeping **Brief → Modules → Work → Money** as the spine

Xentri's long-term ambition: become the go-to "calm Business OS" for anyone building or running a business — starting with sharp beachheads, not ending there.

| **NPS** | Would they recommend? | >40 |
| **Referral %** | New users from word-of-mouth | >20% |

### North Star & Success Metrics

#### Primary North Star

**"Weekly Active Revenue Events per Organization"**

Number of quotes sent + invoices issued + payments recorded per active organization per week.

This captures the core value: Xentri helps people turn work into money.

If this number is healthy and growing, it means:
- Organizations are moving through the full funnel (Brief → Modules → Work → Revenue)
- Xentri is being used for real business, not just setup
- Users are seeing tangible ROI — money is flowing through the system

#### Supporting Metrics by Tier

Because not every org has invoicing from day one, we track tier-appropriate metrics:

| Tier | Primary Metric | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Free** | Brief completion rate | They're getting clarity |
| **Presencia** ($10) | Leads captured per week | Website is working |
| **Light Ops** ($30) | Quotes created per week | CRM / quote flow is working |
| **Business in Motion** ($90) | Invoices sent per week | Full funnel is working |
| **Professional** ($270) | Revenue events per org per week | Multi-user ops are working |

These are "local North Stars" that roll up into the global **Weekly Active Revenue Events** metric.

#### Secondary / Health Metrics

**Brief-to-Value Velocity** — median days from `brief_completed` → first revenue event (quote or invoice).
- If velocity improves, Xentri is making users more efficient at turning clarity into income.
- If velocity worsens, something in the flow is adding friction.

**Open Loops Closed per Week** — how often users resolve follow-ups, quotes, and overdue items surfaced by Xentri.
- Correlates with perceived "peace of mind"
- Tells us the Calm Prompt is being used

**Module Expansion Rate** — average new modules added per user per quarter.
- Indicates users are finding value and growing with the platform

## MVP Scope

### What "MVP" Means for Xentri

Xentri's MVP is not one product — it's a **progressive release** where each version adds complete, usable capability:

| Release | Tier | What Ships | Validation Focus |
|---------|------|------------|------------------|
| **v0.1** | Free | Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief | Brief completion, conversation quality |
| **v0.2** | Presencia ($10) | Brand & Marketing: Website Builder + CMS + Lead Capture | Free→paid conversion, live websites |
| **v0.3** | Light Ops ($30) | Sales & Pipeline: CRM + Quotes + Follow-ups | Upgrade rate, real quote usage |
| **v0.4** | Business in Motion ($90) | Finance & Accounting: Invoicing + Payments + Open Loops | Real invoices, multi-user adoption |

Each release is shippable and valuable on its own. We don't wait for "the full OS" to launch.

### MVP Success Criteria

**Philosophy: Build → Ship → Measure → Learn → Iterate**

These criteria are **validation signals**, not gates. We don't wait for v0.1 to hit all targets before starting v0.2. We ship, measure, learn, and iterate in parallel. Stagnation is death.

The metrics tell us what's working and what needs attention — not whether we have permission to keep building.

**v0.1 (Free) — Validation Signals:**
- Are users completing the Universal Brief? (Target: 70%+)
- Does the Strategy Co-pilot conversation feel natural? (Qualitative feedback)
- Is the Event Backbone reliably logging events? (Technical validation)
- What's blocking users who drop off? (Learn and fix)

**v0.2 (Presencia) — Validation Signals:**
- Are free users converting to paid? (Target: 20%+, but learn from every conversion and every drop-off)
- Are websites going live? (Any live website = proof of value)
- Is the Brief → Website flow working? (Does auto-populated content make sense?)
- What do users ask the Brand Co-pilot for? (Roadmap input)

**v0.3 (Light Ops) — Validation Signals:**
- Are Presencia users upgrading? (Target: 20%+, but understand *why* or *why not*)
- Are users creating real quotes? (Real data > test data)
- Is the pipeline being used weekly? (Engagement signal)
- What's missing? (Every support ticket is roadmap input)

**v0.4 (Business in Motion) — Validation Signals:**
- Are users sending real invoices? (Revenue flowing through system)
- Is the Open Loops view being used? (Calm Prompt working)
- Are teams inviting members? (Multi-user adoption)
- What makes users stay vs. churn? (Retention drivers)

**The Real Success Criterion:**

Every release teaches us something. If we're learning and shipping, we're succeeding. If we're waiting for perfect numbers, we're dying.

**Motto: Build, review, improve, iterate — or die.**

### Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Strategy Co-pilot quality** (v0.1) | Medium-High | High | Constrain scope: produce Brief, not full automation. Fall back to guided form if AI fails. |
| **Low free→paid conversion** (v0.1→v0.2) | Medium-High | High | Brief completion triggers personalized upgrade prompts; AI recommends next modules |
| **Low upgrade rate** (v0.2→v0.3) | Medium | High | Usage-based triggers ("5 new leads—want to track them?"); value demonstration in dashboard |
| **Website builder scope creep** | High | Medium | Evaluate GrapesJS/Craft.js instead of building from scratch; launch with 3-4 quality templates |
| **Incumbent AI catch-up** | Medium | Medium-High | Differentiate on Brief→Modules (structure), not just content generation |
| **Co-pilot hallucination** | Medium | High | Scaffolding only—AI proposes, user confirms. No auto-publish. Logged proposals. |
| **Multi-tenant data leaks** | Low | Critical | Paranoid testing; every query includes `org_id`; RLS in Postgres; code review checklist |

---

## Market Context

### Category Reality

"Business OS" is useful internally — it describes what we're building. But users don't search for "Business OS." They search for "how to start a business," "small business website," "invoice software for contractors," or "AI business assistant."

**Positioning ladder:**
- **Acquisition (Founders):** "Turn your idea into a real business" (clarity, structure)
- **Acquisition (SMBs):** "From your website to your invoices" (tangible, searchable)
- **Retention:** "Everything in one calm workspace" (value realization)
- **Internal/Investor:** "The Business OS" (mental model, category creation)

### Geographic Focus

Xentri is an **English-first** application.

- **Primary (Phase 1–2):** English-speaking SMEs in the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and other markets where English is the default for business tools.

- **Secondary (Phase 2+):** Spanish-speaking markets (Mexico, Spain, LatAm), where we can go deeper on local invoicing and compliance (e.g., CFDI in Mexico, SII in Spain).

- **Later expansion (Phase 3+):** German, French, Italian, and Portuguese markets, once the core product and vertical playbooks are mature.

Compliance notes (CFDI, SII, etc.) still matter, but they're part of the **secondary** geo thesis, not the primary story.

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Right to Win |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Wix / Squarespace** | Best-in-class design, AI copy/image helpers | They generate pages; we generate clarity (Brief) + structure (Modules) + recommendations. |
| **Jobber / Jane** | Deep vertical ops, scheduling, mobile | They expect you to configure; we scaffold via conversation. They're tool-first; we're clarity-first. |
| **GoHighLevel** | Powerful marketing automation, agency focus | They assume an expert admin; we assume a busy owner + AI co-pilot. |
| **Odoo** | Huge module ecosystem, ERP depth | They require consultants; we start with a guided chat. They're overwhelming; we're calm. |
| **HubSpot Starter** | Great UX, strong brand | Marketing-first, not ops-first; expensive at scale; no free clarity tool. |
| **Notion / Linear** | Flexible workspace, loved by founders | Infinite flexibility = infinite setup. No guidance, no co-pilot, no Brief→Module flow. |

**The AI Differentiator (Honest):**

We're not claiming "no one does AI." Everyone's adding AI. What we claim:
- They use AI to generate **content** (pages, copy, images).
- We use AI to generate **clarity** (Brief) and **structure** (Modules, flows, recommendations).
- We start free with an AI that helps you think, not just produce.

That's a meaningful difference for someone who doesn't just need prettier output — they need their business to make sense.

### Pricing Validation

From market research, Xentri's pricing model is competitive — and the module-based approach offers unique flexibility:

| Tier | Xentri | Competitor Benchmark | Verdict |
|------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| **Free** | Strategy Co-pilot + Brief | No direct competitor | **Category-defining** — no one offers free business clarity tool |
| **Presencia** ($10/mo, 3 modules) | Website + Lead Capture + CMS | Wix $17/mo, Squarespace $16/mo | **Aggressive** — undercuts incumbents, adds AI |
| **Light Ops** ($30/mo, 8 modules) | + CRM + Quotes + Pipeline | Jobber $39/mo, Jane $54/mo, Clio $39/mo | **Sweet spot** — undercuts vertical SaaS significantly |
| **Business in Motion** ($90/mo, ~24 modules) | + Invoicing + Payments + Open Loops + Multi-user | Jobber $119/mo, Toast $110/mo | **Competitive** — offers "OS" value at mid-tier price |
| **Professional** ($270/mo, ~72 modules) | Full specialization + roles | GoHighLevel $297/mo, Jobber $199/mo | **Aligned** — matches "Pro" tiers of major players |

**À la carte ($5/module):** Unique in the market. Competitors force tier upgrades for single features. Xentri lets users add exactly what they need.

**Bundle savings (~25-33%):** Incentivizes commitment without forcing it. Users can calculate: "Am I better off with the bundle or à la carte?" — and the answer is usually bundles.

**Personalized bundles:** The real differentiator. A plumber's $10 tier looks different from a founder's $10 tier. No one else does this.

**Pricing reality:** Our pricing isn't revolutionary — it's honest and flexible. The real value proposition is:
1. Start free (no one else offers this with real functionality)
2. Pay only for what you use
3. Get personalized recommendations, not a feature catalog
4. Save by bundling when it makes sense

### Strategic Threats

**Threat 1: Website Builders Adding Ops + AI**

Wix and Squarespace are moving from "Site Builders" to "Business Solutions":
- Wix: Built-in CRM, invoicing, automations, AI copy generation
- Squarespace: "Projects" hub, invoicing, scheduling (Acuity)

**Xentri's defense:** They use AI to generate **pages and content**, not **business clarity and structure**. They're marketing-centric, not clarity-centric. They lack a free entry point, a conversational co-pilot, and personalized module recommendations. We start with clarity (Brief), then deliver tools — they start with tools and assume clarity.

**Threat 2: Vertical SaaS Adding AI Setup**

Jobber and Jane could add AI-powered setup or website builders.

**Xentri's defense:** Clarity-first positioning means we capture users before they even know what tools they need. Vertical SaaS would be bolting on AI setup to existing users; we're capturing new users at the "I need to figure out my business" stage and growing them. Also: our AI is core to the experience, not a bolt-on.

**Threat 3: WhatsApp / Meta Business Suite**

Meta is expanding WhatsApp Business features (catalogs, payments, CRM-like features).

**Xentri's defense:** WhatsApp is a channel, not an OS. Xentri works WITH WhatsApp (copy messages, send notifications) rather than trying to replace it. If Meta builds a full Business OS, everyone has a problem—but it's unlikely they'll go that deep into operations.

### Market Timing

**Why now:**

1. **AI expectation shift** — Users now expect software to be "smart." AI-assisted setup isn't a gimmick anymore; it's table stakes. Xentri's conversational onboarding fits the moment.

2. **Post-COVID digital acceleration** — SMBs that resisted going digital are now forced to. The "I don't need a website" holdouts are shrinking.

3. **Inflation pressure** — Lost jobs and late invoices hurt more. The ROI of "not dropping balls" is higher than ever.

4. **English-first market depth** — The US/UK/AU SMB market is massive and underserved by "calm" tools. Most all-in-ones are overwhelming; most simple tools are shallow.

---

## Technical Preferences

### Philosophy

**"Decoupled Unity"** — The user sees one calm workspace; under the hood, each capability is an independent module organized into seven categories. Modules can be built, deployed, and billed separately while sharing the same shell, data model, and event backbone.

**"Clarity Before Tools"** — The Universal Brief is the source of truth. Every module reads from it. Every recommendation is based on it. Users achieve clarity first; tools follow.

**"Event Backbone as Source of Truth"** — Every business action is an explicit event. This enables audit trails, "what happened" timelines, the Open Loops view, and cross-module intelligence without complex queries or manual tracking.

**"AI as Infrastructure, Not Magic"** — The AI co-pilots are scaffolding tools that generate clarity (Brief) and structure (Modules, flows), not black boxes that "handle everything." Users can always see and override what the AI proposes.

**"Co-pilot Swarm"** — One Strategy Co-pilot orchestrates; six category co-pilots specialize. They share infrastructure but have distinct personas, tools, and access. The user experiences helpful experts; under the hood, it's configured runtimes calling LLM APIs.

### Stack Direction (Not Locked)

These are strong preferences, not mandates. Final decisions belong to the architecture phase.

| Layer | Preference | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| **Frontend Shell** | Astro + React Islands | SSR for fast initial load; React for rich interactivity; lazy-load modules to keep shell light |
| **Backend Services** | Node.js (TypeScript) for most; Python for AI/ML | Type safety across the stack; Python ecosystem for LLM work |
| **Database** | Postgres (single cluster, schema-per-service) | Mature, reliable, excellent JSON support for events; RLS for multi-tenancy |
| **Event Transport** | Redis Streams → n8n | Fast internal sync; n8n for visible, editable business logic |
| **AI Layer** | OpenAI API (or compatible) | Best-in-class for conversational scaffolding; can swap providers later |

**Architecture Hierarchy:**

| Layer | Technology | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Shell** | Astro | Stable container — header + collapsible sidebar. Never blinks. |
| **Category** | Astro Pages | Entry points for each of the 7 categories |
| **Subcategory (SPA)** | React | Each category has up to 10 React micro-apps (e.g., "The War Room") |
| **Module** | React Components | Each SPA has up to 10 modules as tabs |
| **Backend** | Docker Microservices | Each module powered by 1+ microservices |
| **Co-pilot** | Python/Node.js Service | Stateless agents with configured personas, calling LLM APIs |

**The Click Flow:**
1. User clicks category in sidebar → Astro swaps `<main>` content
2. User clicks subcategory → Astro loads React SPA
3. User clicks tab → React Router switches component (no page reload)
4. User interacts → React state + API calls to backend microservices

### Non-Negotiables

1. **Multi-tenant from day zero** — Every table has `org_id`; Row-Level Security enforced in Postgres; no shortcuts.

2. **Event-first data model** — All significant actions write to `system_events` before updating domain tables. This is the audit trail and the basis for Open Loops.

3. **Visible automations** — Every automated action (AI-generated, workflow-triggered, or scheduled) is logged with a human-readable explanation. No black boxes.

4. **Modular frontend** — Switching between categories and modules should feel like changing panels, not loading a new app. Shared shell, lazy-loaded SPAs.

5. **API-first backend** — Every capability is accessible via API. The frontend is just one client; future mobile apps, integrations, and the AI co-pilots are others.

6. **Category-based organization** — All modules belong to one of 7 categories. Navigation reflects this. Billing reflects this. Co-pilots specialize by this.

7. **Co-pilot per category** — Each category has a specialized co-pilot that unlocks with the first module subscription in that category. Strategy Co-pilot is always available (free tier).

8. **Brief as source of truth** — The Universal Brief is not just onboarding. It's a living document that modules read from. Website pulls business name. CRM pulls audience. Quotes pull pricing.

### AI Co-pilot Technical Constraints

The co-pilots are core differentiators, but must be constrained to be reliable:

**Architecture:**
- **Swarm model:** One `ai-service` hosts all co-pilots as configured runtimes
- **Stateless:** Co-pilots spin up per request, not persistent servers
- **Configuration-driven:** Each co-pilot defined by system prompt + tools + model + temperature
- **Orchestration:** Strategy Co-pilot can route to or spawn category co-pilots

**Constraints:**

| Constraint | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| **Scaffolding, not generation** | AI proposes Brief structure, website layout, module recommendations; user confirms. AI doesn't publish directly. |
| **Graceful fallback** | If AI fails or user opts out, they land on a guided form or template picker — never a blank screen. |
| **Logged proposals** | Every AI suggestion is logged as an event (`ai_proposal_generated`), so we can audit and improve. |
| **No hallucinated data** | AI can structure user input; it cannot invent clients, invoices, or business data. |
| **Context boundaries** | Each co-pilot only reads data relevant to its category. Sales Co-pilot doesn't see Finance data unless explicitly shared. |
| **User confirmation required** | For any action that creates, updates, or deletes business data, user must confirm. No auto-actions on real data. |

**Co-pilot Registry Example:**

```json
{
  "strategy_copilot": {
    "system_prompt": "You are the Strategy Co-pilot. Your goal is clarity...",
    "tools": ["read_brief", "update_brief", "recommend_modules", "route_to_category"],
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.7
  },
  "brand_copilot": {
    "system_prompt": "You are the Brand Co-pilot. You help with website and marketing...",
    "tools": ["read_brief", "suggest_copy", "review_content", "update_website"],
    "model": "claude-3-opus",
    "temperature": 0.8
  },
  "finance_copilot": {
    "system_prompt": "You are the Finance Co-pilot. You help with invoicing and money...",
    "tools": ["read_brief", "analyze_revenue", "flag_overdue", "suggest_pricing"],
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.3
  }
}
```

### Hierarchical Knowledge Architecture

The agent system mirrors the UI architecture with a three-tier knowledge hierarchy:

**Knowledge Hierarchy:**

| Level | Source of Truth | Who Has Access | Example |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Universal Brief** | Identity, Audience, Offerings, Positioning, Operations, Goals, Proof | All 7 Category Agents | Business name, target customer, pricing |
| **Category Context** | Category-specific rules, preferences, accumulated knowledge | That Category Agent + its Subagents | Brand voice, sales pipeline stages, financial policies |
| **Module Context** | Module-specific data, configurations, history | That Subagent only | Website page structure, specific client records, quote templates |

**Agent Hierarchy:**

```
UNIVERSAL BRIEF (Shared source of truth for all)
│
├── STRATEGY AGENT (Category)
│   ├── Strategy Context
│   └── Subagents (up to 10, one per subcategory/SPA)
│       ├── War Room Agent → War Room Context
│       ├── North Star Agent → North Star Context
│       └── Brain Agent → Brain Context
│
├── BRAND AGENT (Category)
│   ├── Brand Context (brand guidelines, voice, visual identity)
│   └── Subagents
│       ├── Website Builder Agent → Website Context
│       ├── CMS Agent → Content Context
│       └── Lead Capture Agent → Lead Context
│
├── SALES AGENT (Category)
│   ├── Sales Context (pipeline rules, qualification criteria)
│   └── Subagents
│       ├── CRM Agent → Client Context
│       ├── Quote Agent → Quote Context
│       └── Pipeline Agent → Pipeline Context
│
└── ... (Finance, Operations, Team, Legal follow same pattern)
```

**Interaction Pattern:**

1. **User talks to Category Agent** (e.g., "I need to update my website")
2. **Category Agent analyzes intent**, determines which module is relevant
3. **Category Agent calls Subagent** (Website Builder Agent)
4. **Subagent has full context**: Universal Brief + Category Context + Module Context
5. **Subagent does the work** (retrieve, edit, create)
6. **Subagent reports back** to Category Agent
7. **Category Agent responds** to user

**Key Principles:**

- **Users only interact with Category Agents** — Subagents are invisible workers
- **Each agent only knows what it needs** — Context boundaries prevent information overload
- **Every module has an agent** — Either a Category Agent owns it directly, or a Subagent specializes in it
- **Subagents can call each other** — Within the same category, for cross-module operations
- **Category Agents can route to other Category Agents** — Via Strategy Agent orchestration

*(Full agent architecture specification to be detailed in Architecture document)*

### Golden Path Templates

For each target segment (founders, trades, clinics, workshops), Xentri maintains opinionated "golden path" setups: pre-configured Brief structures, services, and basic flows that represent the most common patterns for that business type.

The AI co-pilot begins from the conversation, but if the conversation is short, messy, or low-confidence, it snaps to the closest golden path so the user never sees a blank canvas. AI scaffolding + golden paths together avoid the "getting stuck" cliff during setup.

**Example:** A plumber who types "I do water heaters and drain cleaning" gets snapped to the Trades golden path with those two services pre-filled—not a blank website builder.

### Performance Targets (v0.1)

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Initial load (shell)** | <2s on 3G | First impression; many SMB owners on mobile/slow connections |
| **Time to Brief completion** | <10 min from sign-up | AI onboarding must feel fast and valuable |
| **Module switch** | <500ms | Feels like changing tabs, not loading a new app |
| **Event write latency** | <100ms | Every action should feel instant |

### What We Won't Build (Technical)

- **Custom email infrastructure** — Use transactional email provider (Resend, Postmark, etc.)
- **Custom auth** — Use Supabase Auth or similar; don't roll our own
- **Custom PDF rendering** — Use proven library (PDFKit, Puppeteer, etc.)
- **Custom payment processing** — Integrate Stripe, not build our own gateway

### The Eject Button (Data Portability)

From day one, users can export all core business data (clients, jobs, invoices, payments) to clean CSV/Excel. Xentri should feel like a trustworthy steward of data, not a trap; easy export is a deliberate design choice to reduce "lock-in" anxiety.

This also supports the "Tax Pack" export for accountants and builds trust with skeptical owners who've been burned by tools that held their data hostage.

---

## Risks and Assumptions

### Key Assumptions

These are beliefs we're treating as true. If any prove false, the strategy may need to change.

| Assumption | Why We Believe It | How We'll Validate |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Users want clarity before tools** | Research shows anxiety about "where to start"; founders and SMBs alike struggle to articulate their business | Track Brief completion rate; qualitative feedback on co-pilot conversations |
| **Free co-pilot creates conversion funnel** | Users who invest time in clarity will want tools to act on it | Track free → paid conversion; Brief completion → first module correlation |
| **Personalized bundles outperform fixed tiers** | Different users have different entry points; one-size-fits-all creates friction | A/B test personalized vs. fixed recommendations; track upgrade paths |
| **AI onboarding reduces setup friction** | Conversational setup is faster than forms; users expect AI in 2025 | Track time-to-Brief-completion; compare AI vs. guided form path |
| **Category specialists will adopt at scale** | As businesses grow, they want to delegate — accountant for Finance, marketer for Brand | Track multi-user adoption at $90+ tiers; category-specific login patterns |
| **$5/module is the right price point** | Low enough for experimentation, high enough for sustainable revenue | Monitor à la carte vs. bundle mix; test $3 and $7 price points |
| **English-speaking markets are sufficient for Phase 1** | US/UK/AU SMB market is massive; simpler compliance | Revenue and user growth in Phase 1-3 |

### Known Risks

Summary of key risks (detailed mitigations in MVP Scope section):

| Risk | Severity | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Strategy Co-pilot quality | High | Active mitigation: constrained scope, graceful fallback to guided forms |
| Low free→paid conversion | High | Active mitigation: Brief completion triggers personalized upgrade prompts |
| Low upgrade rate between tiers | Medium-High | Active mitigation: usage-based triggers, value demonstration |
| Incumbent AI catch-up | Medium-High | Active mitigation: differentiate on clarity + structure, not content |
| Website builder scope creep | Medium | Active mitigation: evaluate existing libraries, limit initial templates |
| Co-pilot hallucination/errors | Medium-High | Active mitigation: scaffolding only, user confirmation required, logged proposals |
| Multi-tenant data leaks | Critical | Active mitigation: RLS, code review checklist, paranoid testing |
| Category co-pilot complexity | Medium | Active mitigation: start with Strategy only, add categories incrementally |

### Open Questions

These need answers before or during implementation:

1. **Co-pilot model selection**: Should each category co-pilot use the optimal model (Claude for creative, GPT-4 for analytical), or standardize on one provider for simplicity?

2. **Brief schema versioning**: How do we handle Brief updates when modules depend on specific Brief fields? Migration strategy?

3. **Module pricing granularity**: Is $5/module the right unit, or should some complex modules cost more? (e.g., Website Builder vs. simple list view)

4. **Template library**: Build templates in-house or partner/license? How many templates for v0.2 launch?

5. **Mobile-first or desktop-first**: SMB owners often work on phones, but complex editing (quotes, invoices) may need desktop. What's the priority?

6. **Offline capability**: Do modules need to work offline (PWA)? Which ones? How do we sync?

7. **Co-pilot memory**: How much conversation history should co-pilots retain? Per-session? Per-category? Forever?

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Owner | Risk if Delayed |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Supabase/Auth provider** | External | Blocks all development |
| **AI API access (OpenAI/Anthropic)** | External | Blocks co-pilot development; fallback to guided forms |
| **LangGraph/AutoGen framework** | External | Blocks multi-agent orchestration; can start with single agent |
| **Domain provider integration** | External | Blocks custom domain feature in Website Builder |
| **Transactional email provider** | External | Blocks lead notifications, invoice emails |
| **PDF library selection** | Internal | Blocks quote/invoice PDF generation |
| **GrapesJS/Craft.js evaluation** | Internal | Blocks Website Builder architecture decision |
