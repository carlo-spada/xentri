## Partial Item: n8n Consistency

**Issue:** The document contains conflicting information about n8n's role.

**Removed from:**
- The Stack table (lines 28-36) — n8n no longer listed
- Bootstrap commands (line 742) — no `n8n` in docker compose

**Still referenced in:**
- Line 516: "n8n-host" mentioned as future service
- Line 831: "Background Jobs: Event handlers must be idempotent" (correct, no n8n)
- Line 1027: "n8n Reliability: Workers run with queue-backed execution..." (still references n8n)
- Line 1035: DLQ table lists `n8n:dlq` stream
- Line 1043-1046: Redis commands reference `n8n:dlq` and `n8n:jobs`
- Line 1123: Scaling trigger mentions "add n8n worker pods"

**Impact:** Agents implementing background jobs may be confused about whether to use n8n or Redis event handlers.

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. **Remove n8n completely:** Remove all references (lines 516, 1027, 1035, 1043-1046, 1123) and rename DLQ streams
2. **Keep n8n as optional:** Add explicit section clarifying n8n is optional orchestration layer on top of Redis event handlers

## Document Quality Score

| Dimension | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Architecture Completeness | **Complete** |
| Version Specificity | **All Verified** |
| Pattern Clarity | **Clear** (minor n8n ambiguity) |
| AI Agent Readiness | **Ready** |

---

## Conclusion

The architecture document is **ready for implementation** with one minor consistency issue. The n8n references should be reconciled before Epic 2 to avoid agent confusion.
