## 1. Competitor Watch (Frequency: Monthly)

**Goal:** Detect "Feature Creep" and "Pivot Signals" from key rivals before they become threats.

### Prompt: The "Wedge" Check
> "Analyze the public changelogs, help center updates, and blog posts for **Jobber**, **Jane App**, **Wix**, and **GoHighLevel** from the last 30 days.
>
> **Focus on:**
> 1.  **AI Features:** Are they launching any 'AI Assistants' or 'Auto-complete' features?
> 2.  **Marketing Tools:** Are Jobber/Jane adding email marketing or website builders?
> 3.  **Operations:** Are Wix/GHL adding 'Dispatching' or 'SOAP Notes'?
>
> **Output:** A table summarizing 'New Capabilities' vs. 'Xentri Threat Level' (Low/Med/High)."

### Prompt: The "Pricing" Check
> "Search for recent 'Jobber pricing increase' or 'Wix price hike' discussions on Reddit and Twitter from the last 3 months.
>
> **Identify:**
> 1.  Specific % increases.

>
> **Output:** A summary of 'Vulnerability Windows' where Xentri can attack with better pricing."

## 2. Customer Pulse (Frequency: Weekly)

**Goal:** Keep the "Open Loop Anxiety" copy fresh and resonant.

### Prompt: The "Pain" Miner
> "Search **Reddit** (r/plumbing, r/HVAC, r/therapists, r/smallbusiness) and **Twitter** for posts from the last 7 days containing keywords: 'admin', 'paperwork', 'software', 'scheduling', 'invoice', 'burnout', 'overwhelmed'.
>
> **Extract:**
> 1.  **Direct Quotes:** 5-10 raw, emotional quotes describing the pain of administrative work.
> 2.  **Trigger Events:** What specific event caused the rant? (e.g., 'Client didn't pay', 'Lost a note').
> 3.  **Wishlist:** What do they explicitly say they *wish* existed?
>
> **Output:** A 'Voice of Customer' update for the marketing team."

## 3. Regulatory & Compliance (Frequency: Quarterly)

**Goal:** Ensure "Calm" doesn't turn into "Legal Panic".

### Prompt: The "Red Tape" Scan
> "Research upcoming regulatory changes for **US Small Businesses** in 2026, specifically focusing on:
> 1.  **HIPAA:** Any new digital privacy rules for private practices?
> 2.  **FinCEN/BOI:** Updates on 'Beneficial Ownership Information' reporting requirements.

## 4. Emerging Tech (Frequency: Monthly)

**Goal:** Spot the *next* wedge before it's obvious.

### Prompt: The "AI in the Wild" Scan
> "Search for 'AI tools for plumbers' and 'AI scribes for therapists' launched in the last 3 months on Product Hunt and Twitter.
>
> **Analyze:**
> 1.  **Adoption:** Are real tradespeople actually using them, or is it just hype?
> 2.  **Form Factor:** Is it Voice-to-Text? Image recognition? Chatbot?
> 3.  **Pricing:** How are they charging? (Per seat vs. Usage).
>
> **Output:** A 'Tech Radar' assessment. Should Xentri build, buy, or ignore?"
