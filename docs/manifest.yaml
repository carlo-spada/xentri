# ZERO-TRUST HIERARCHY MODEL
# =============================================================================
#
# Communication Rules:
# - Children DO work and EXPOSE upward to parent
# - Parent CURATES what's shared between siblings
# - Children NEVER see siblings directly
# - No direct sibling negotiation
# - No skip-level visibility
#
# Amendment Flow:
# - Children don't propose amendments (they don't know siblings exist)
# - Parents author amendments when they decide to expose/share/integrate

# NAVIGATION GUIDE
# =============================================================================
#
# When starting a session, agents should:
# 1. Read this manifest to understand the structure
# 2. Ask: "Which entity are you working on?"
# 3. Determine entity type from path
# 4. Navigate to appropriate location
#
# Entity Type Detection:
#   docs/platform/*.md              -> constitution
#   docs/platform/{module}/         -> infrastructure_module
#   docs/{category}/                -> strategic_container (if has children)
#   docs/{category}/{subcat}/       -> coordination_unit (if has children)
#   docs/{cat}/{subcat}/{module}/   -> business_module
#
# Example session starts:
#   User: "Working on core-api"
#   Agent: "Infrastructure Module: docs/platform/core-api/"
#
#   User: "Working on strategy"
#   Agent: "Strategic Container: docs/strategy/"
#
#   User: "Working on god-view in strategy/pulse"
#   Agent: "Business Module: docs/strategy/pulse/god-view/"

# INHERITANCE RULES (Zero-Trust)
# =============================================================================
#
# Children inherit from parent ONLY (no skip-level):
# - Business Module inherits: Coordination Unit PRD
# - Coordination Unit inherits: Strategic Container PRD
# - Strategic Container inherits: Constitution
# - Infrastructure Module inherits: Constitution
#
# Each level can ADD requirements but NEVER CONTRADICT parent.
#
# Documents use frontmatter to declare their entity type:
#   ---
#   entity_type: constitution | infrastructure_module | strategic_container | coordination_unit | business_module
#   document_type: prd | architecture | epics | ux-design | product-soul
#   parent: path/to/parent/prd.md (for non-constitution entities)
