# NAVIGATION GUIDE
# =============================================================================
#
# When starting a session, agents should:
# 1. Read this manifest to understand the structure
# 2. Ask: "Which category and sub-category are you working on?"
# 3. Navigate to docs/{category}/{subcategory}/
# 4. If working on a specific module, navigate to docs/{category}/{subcategory}/{module}/
#
# Example session start:
#   Agent: "Which area are you working on?"
#   User: "core-api"
#   Agent: "Working in platform/backend/core-api for this session."
