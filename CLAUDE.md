# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Xentri** is a modular Business OS that starts with conversation, not configuration. It uses a **Strategy Co-pilot** to generate a **Universal Brief** (the DNA of a business), which then powers a curated set of tools (Website, CRM, Invoicing) organized into 7 capability categories.

**Status:** Foundation complete (Epic 1 - Story 1.1 done). Infrastructure established with multi-tenant RLS, CI/CD, and 14 tests passing.

## Architecture Philosophy: "Decoupled Unity"

The user sees one calm workspace; under the hood, each capability is an isolated module:

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|-------|------------|------|
| **Shell** | Astro | Stable container (header + sidebar), handles routing and auth |
| **Micro-Apps** | React Islands | Interactive SPAs lazy-loaded into the Shell |
| **Backend** | Node.js (Docker) | Microservices per domain (core-api, sales-engine, finance-engine) |
| **AI Service** | Python | Co-pilot Swarm host (Strategy, Brand, Sales, Finance agents) |
| **Data** | Postgres | Single cluster, schema-per-service, RLS for multi-tenancy |
| **Events** | Redis Streams → n8n | "Nervous System" for async event transport and workflow orchestration |

**Non-negotiables:**
- Multi-tenant from day zero: every table has `org_id` with Row-Level Security
- Event-first: all business actions write to `system_events` before domain tables
- Visible automation: every automated action logged with human-readable explanation
- Services communicate via events, not direct calls

## Development Commands

```bash
# Setup
pnpm install                           # Install all workspace dependencies
docker compose up -d postgres redis    # Start Postgres 16.11 + Redis 8.0
pnpm run db:migrate                    # Apply Prisma migrations with RLS

# Development
pnpm run dev                           # Start all services (Astro + Core API)
pnpm run dev --filter apps/shell       # Start shell only (port 4321)
pnpm run dev --filter services/core-api # Start API only (port 3000)

# Testing
pnpm run test                          # Run all unit tests
pnpm run test -- --coverage            # Run tests with coverage report
pnpm run test:smoke                    # Run smoke tests (RLS, Brief flow, timing)
pnpm run typecheck                     # TypeScript validation

# Build & Quality
pnpm run build                         # Build all packages
pnpm run lint                          # Run ESLint

# Observability (Story 1.7)
LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm run dev           # Enable debug logging
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health       # API health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health/ready # API readiness with DB check
```

## Observability

**Structured Logging (NFR24):**
- JSON format in production, pretty print in development
- Correlation IDs: `trace_id`, `org_id`, `user_id` in every log entry
- PII scrubbing: email, name, auth headers redacted
- Log levels: `LOG_LEVEL=error|warn|info|debug`

**Error Tracking (NFR25):**
- Sentry integration (configure `SENTRY_DSN`)
- Stack traces with request context
- Automatic error capture in API and shell

**Health Checks:**
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Basic liveness
- `GET /api/v1/health/ready` - Readiness with database check

**Trace Propagation:**
- `x-trace-id` header for request correlation
- W3C `traceparent` header support

## Key Technical Patterns

### Event Backbone
- All events stored in `system_events` table (append-only, immutable)
- Events power: timelines, audit trails, Open Loops/Calm Prompt, cross-module intelligence
- Corrections via compensating events, never edit history
- Outbox pattern: Postgres → Redis Streams for cross-service transport

### Frontend Architecture
- Shell loads instantly (~15kb), sidebar/header persist across navigation
- React SPAs lazy-loaded via `client:only="react"` with hover prefetching
- Cross-app state via Nano Stores, server state via TanStack Query
- Error boundaries prevent "white screen of death"

### AI Co-pilots
- Swarm model: one `ai-service` hosts all co-pilots as configured runtimes
- Stateless: spin up per request with system prompt + tools + model config
- Scaffolding only: AI proposes, user confirms—no auto-publish
- Each category has a specialized co-pilot that unlocks with first module subscription

## BMAD Framework

This project uses BMAD for AI-assisted development workflows:

| Directory | Purpose |

| `.bmad/bmb/` | BMad Builder - agent/workflow creation tools |
| `.bmad/cis/` | Creative & Innovation Suite |
| `.bmad/core/` | Core utilities and brainstorming |
| `.claude/commands/` | Slash commands available via `/bmad:*` |

Key workflows:

- `/bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story` - Implement stories

Workflow status tracked in `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`.

## Key Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `architecture.md` | Technical Constitution - data governance, service boundaries |
| `docs/product-brief-*.md` | Complete product vision, personas, MVP scope |
| `docs/architecture/event-model-v0.1.md` | Event Backbone schema and patterns |
| `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` | Current workflow progress |

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity First** - Universal Brief before tools; AI generates structure, not just content
2. **Calm UX** - One daily view of what matters; no notification flood
3. **Visible, Not Magical** - Every automation logged with explanation
4. **Modular Growth** - Start free, add $5 modules, grow to bundles
5. **Works With Reality** - WhatsApp copy-paste flows, not rigid forms

## Current Phase
