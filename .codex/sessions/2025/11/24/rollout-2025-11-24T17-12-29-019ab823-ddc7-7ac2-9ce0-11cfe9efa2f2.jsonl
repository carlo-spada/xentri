It is the \"Constitution\" for how we build, enabling us to add new modules (CMS, Marketing, HR) indefinitely without creating a monolith.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nThis platform is designed to be an **\"Operating System for Business,\"** automating disparate functions (CRM, ERP, AI Bots, Legal) into a single, cohesive experience.\n\nUnlike traditional SaaS which suffers from \"tab fatigue\" (switching between different tools), this architecture uses a **Unified App Shell** to provide a seamless, native-app feel while maintaining strict technical isolation between services for scalability and team autonomy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Blueprint: \"Decoupled Unity\"\n\nWe strictly separate the **User Experience** from the **Business Logic**.\n\n| Layer | Metaphor | Role |\n|-------|----------|------|\n| **The Shell (Astro)** | The \"Body\" | A lightweight, server-rendered container that handles the frame, authentication, and routing. It creates the illusion of a Single Page Application (SPA). |\n| **The Organs (React Micro-Apps)** | The \"Capabilities\" | Interactive tools (CRM, ERP) bundled as libraries and lazy-loaded into the Shell. |\n| **The Engine (Docker Microservices)** | The \"Muscle\" | Isolated backend containers that handle heavy processing, Python/Go logic, and database transactions. |\n| **The Nervous System (Events)** | The \"Signals\" | An event-driven layer that prevents services from talking directly to each other, ensuring the system remains modular. |\n\n### Visual Data Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    User[User Browser] -->|HTTPS| CDN[Edge Network / Vercel]\n    CDN -->|Serves| Shell[Astro App Shell]\n\n    subgraph \"Frontend (Browser)\"\n        Shell -->|Loads| Sidebar[Nano Store UI State]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| CRM[React CRM App]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| ERP[React ERP App]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Backend (Docker Swarm / K8s)\"\n        CRM -->|API JSON| APIG[API Gateway]\n        ERP -->|API JSON| APIG\n\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/crm| Svc1[CRM Service Node]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/erp| Svc2[ERP Service Go/Python]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/bot| Svc3[AI Bot Service Python]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"The Nervous System (Async)\"\n        Svc3 -->|Event: ChatFinished| Redis[Redis Streams]\n        Redis -->|Transport| N8N[n8n Workflow Engine]\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc1\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc2\n    end\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Repository Structure (Turborepo)\n\nWe use a **Monorepo** to share types and UI standards while enforcing strict isolation between business domains.\n\n```\n/business-os-monorepo\n├── /apps\n│   ├── /shell                # ASTRO.

The \"Nervous System\" (Event Architecture)\n\nTo ensure we can continuously plug in new modules (e.g., adding a \"Marketing Module\" next year without rewriting the CRM), we use a **two-layer event system**.\n\n### A. The Transport Layer: Redis Streams\n\n| Attribute | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Role** | High-volume, internal system synchronization. The \"Spinal Cord.\" |\n| **Use Case** | Data Integrity |\n| **Example** | User updates their avatar in the Shell → Redis Event → CRM Service updates its cache → ERP Service updates its cache. |\n| **Why** | It is immutable, blazing fast, and ensures services stay decoupled. |\n\n### B. The Logic Layer: n8n (Self-Hosted)\n\n| Attribute | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Role** | Business Logic Orchestration & Third-Party Integrations. The \"Brain.\" |\n| **Use Case** | Complex, malleable workflows. |\n| **Example** | \"When `lead_status` becomes `won`, generate a PDF contract, sign via DocuSign, and Slack the Sales Manager.\" |\n\n**Why n8n?**\n\n- **Visibility:** Analysts can visualize the business logic flow.\n- **Client Empowerment:** We can expose a restricted view to clients, allowing them to tweak their own automations (e.g., \"Change the alert email address\") without engineering involvement.\n\n### Event Flow Example\n\n```\n1. Bot Service finishes a conversation.\n2. Emits event: conversation.completed\n3. n8n catches event → Triggers \"Sentiment Analysis\" → Triggers \"Update CRM Record\"\n```\n\nThis allows us to add new automations **without touching the code of the core services**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Frontend Strategy: The \"Native PWA\" Feel\n\n**Objective:** Load instantly, transition seamlessly, never flash white.\n\n### A. The Technology Stack\n\n| Component | Technology |\n|-----------|------------|\n| **Host** | Astro (Server-Side Rendering + Client Router) |\n| **Micro-Apps** | React (bundled via Vite) |\n| **State** | Nano Stores (for cross-app UI signaling) |\n| **Data** | TanStack Query (for server-state synchronization) |\n\n### B. The Loading Strategy (Lazy Loading)\n\nWe do **not** bundle the ERP code with the CRM code.\n\n1. **Initial Load:** User downloads `shell.js` (~15kb). They see the Sidebar and Header immediately.\n2. **Interaction:** User clicks \"CRM\".\n3. **Hydration:** Astro's router intercepts the click. It fetches `chunk-crm.js` via `client:only=\"react\"` and mounts it into the content area.\n4. **Transition:** The Sidebar persists. The content area transitions smoothly.\n\n### C. Routing\n\n- Routes like `/crm/*` are Astro pages that mount a specific React Island (`<CrmApp />`).\n- **Error Boundaries:** If the CRM bundle fails to load, the Shell catches the error. The Sidebar remains functional, preventing a \"White Screen of Death.\"\n\n### D. Communication (The \"Store\" Pattern)\n\nApps do **not** talk directly to each other. They talk to a shared Nano Store.\n\n**Example:** CRM updates \"Lead Status\". It calls `notifications.add()`. The Shell (listening to `notifications`) shows a toast.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Backend Strategy & Observability\n\n**Objective:** Isolation and independent scaling.\n\n### A. Containerization\n\nEach folder in `/services/*` has its own `Dockerfile`.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- **Isolation:** If the `bot-processor` crashes due to a memory leak, the `erp-engine` keeps running perfectly.\n- **Scaling:** On Black Friday, we can spin up 50 replicas of `core-api` without paying for extra `bot-processor` instances.\n\n### B. Observability\n\n| Concern | Strategy |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Logging** | Centralized (e.g., Loki/CloudWatch). No `console.log` into the void. |\n| **Tracing** | We tag every request with a `correlation_id` at the API Gateway. This ID follows the request from Frontend → API → Redis → n8n → Database, allowing us to trace a user action across the entire distributed system. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Data Strategy (Multi-Tenancy)\n\n**Objective:** Logical separation on a shared physical resource.\n\n### A. Database Topology\n\nWe will use a **Single Physical Postgres Cluster** (e.g., Supabase) but enforce **Logical Schema Isolation**.\n\n```\nDatabase: business_os_db\n├── Schema: auth           # Supabase managed\n├── Schema: public         # Users, Organizations, Tenants\n├── Schema: crm_service    # Tables: leads, pipelines, activities\n└── Schema: erp_service    # Tables: ledgers, invoices, inventory\n```\n\n### B. Schema Ownership\n\n| Rule | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Strict Rule** | Only the CRM Service can write to `crm_schema`. |\n| **Migrations** | Managed per-service (e.g., Drizzle Kit for Node, Golang Migrate for Go). |\n\n### C. The \"Shared Contract\" (`/packages/ts-schema`)\n\nTo prevent chaos, **no service is allowed to \"guess\" the shape of data**.\n\nWe maintain a shared TypeScript package that exports the Types for every API response and Event payload.\n\n**Rule:** If you change the Database Schema, you **must** update the Shared Types.\n\n### D. Multi-Tenancy (RLS)\n\n| Rule | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Strict Rule** | Every single table in every schema **MUST** have an `organization_id` column. |\n| **Enforcement** | We use Postgres Row Level Security (RLS). |\n| **Mechanism** | The API Gateway passes the User's JWT to the database connection. Postgres itself ensures Customer A never sees Customer B's data, even if the developer makes a mistake in the SQL query. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Development Workflow\n\n### \"Day 1\" Setup\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone Repo\ngit clone https://github.com/your-org/business-os-monorepo.git\n\n# 2. Install Dependencies (Turborepo installs all dependencies for all apps)\nnpm install\n\n# 3. Start Infrastructure (Postgres, Redis, and Backend Services)\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# 4. Start Frontend (Astro Shell and React watchers)\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### \"Day 100\" Deployment\n\n| Layer | Platform |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Frontend** | Vercel / Netlify (Global Edge Network) |\n| **Backend** | AWS ECS / DigitalOcean Kubernetes (Docker Containers) |\n| **Database** | Supabase / AWS RDS |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Future-Proofing Checklist\n\n- [ ] **Unified Auth:** Single JWT verification across all backend services (Supabase Auth). Ensure all backend services verify the same JWT token. Do not create separate user tables for the CRM and ERP. Use a central Identity Provider.\n\n- [ ] **API Gateway:** Unified entry point (Nginx/Kong/Traefik) routing `/api/crm` to the correct container and handling rate limiting.\n\n- [ ] **Feature Flags:** System to toggle modules (e.g., \"Enable Beta Marketing App\") per Organization.\n\n- [ ] **Billing Source of Truth:** All modules must check the Core API for license validity before executing. The CRM app must check the Core API: \"Does this user have the 'Pro' license?\" before rendering premium features.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Service Boundaries\n\n| Service | Owns | Responsibilities |\n|---------|------|------------------|\n| `core-api` | Users, Organizations, Billing | Authentication, Authorization, Subscription Management |\n| `crm-service` | Leads, Pipelines, Activities | Contact Management, Sales Pipeline, Activity Tracking |\n| `erp-engine` | Ledgers, Invoices, Inventory | Financial Calculations, PDF Generation, Inventory Management |\n| `bot-processor` | Conversations, AI Context | LLM Chains, WhatsApp Connectivity, Sentiment Analysis |\n| `n8n-host` | Workflows, Triggers | Business Logic Orchestration, Third-Party Integrations |\n"}}
