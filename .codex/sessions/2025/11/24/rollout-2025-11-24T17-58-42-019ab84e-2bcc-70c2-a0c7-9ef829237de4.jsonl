It is the \"Constitution\" for how we build, enabling us to add new modules (CMS, Marketing, HR) indefinitely without creating a monolith.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nThis platform is designed to be an **\"Operating System for Business,\"** automating disparate functions (CRM, ERP, AI Bots, Legal) into a single, cohesive experience.\n\nUnlike traditional SaaS which suffers from \"tab fatigue\" (switching between different tools), this architecture uses a **Unified App Shell** to provide a seamless, native-app feel while maintaining strict technical isolation between services for scalability and team autonomy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Blueprint: \"Decoupled Unity\"\n\nWe strictly separate the **User Experience** from the **Business Logic**.\n\n| Layer | Metaphor | Role |\n|-------|----------|------|\n| **The Shell (Astro)** | The \"Body\" | A lightweight, server-rendered container that handles the frame, authentication, and routing. It creates the illusion of a Single Page Application (SPA). |\n| **The Organs (React Micro-Apps)** | The \"Capabilities\" | Interactive tools (CRM, ERP) bundled as libraries and lazy-loaded into the Shell. |\n| **The Engine (Docker Microservices)** | The \"Muscle\" | Isolated backend containers that handle heavy processing, Python/Go logic, and database transactions. |\n| **The Nervous System (Events)** | The \"Signals\" | An event-driven layer that prevents services from talking directly to each other, ensuring the system remains modular. |\n\n### Visual Data Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    User[User Browser] -->|HTTPS| CDN[Edge Network / Vercel]\n    CDN -->|Serves| Shell[Astro App Shell]\n\n    subgraph \"Frontend (Browser)\"\n        Shell -->|Loads| Sidebar[Nano Store UI State]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| CRM[React CRM App]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| ERP[React ERP App]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Backend (Docker Swarm / K8s)\"\n        CRM -->|API JSON| APIG[API Gateway]\n        ERP -->|API JSON| APIG\n\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/crm| Svc1[CRM Service Node]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/erp| Svc2[ERP Service Go/Python]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/bot| Svc3[AI Bot Service Python]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"The Nervous System (Async)\"\n        Svc3 -->|Event: ChatFinished| Redis[Redis Streams]\n        Redis -->|Transport| N8N[n8n Workflow Engine]\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc1\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc2\n    end\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Repository Structure (Turborepo)\n\nWe use a **Monorepo** to share types and UI standards while enforcing strict isolation between business domains.\n\n```\n/business-os-monorepo\n├── /apps\n│   ├── /shell                # ASTRO.

The \"Nervous System\" (Event Architecture)\n\nTo ensure we can continuously plug in new modules (e.g., adding a \"Marketing Module\" next year without rewriting the CRM), we use a **two-layer event system**.\n\n### A. The Transport Layer: Redis Streams\n\n| Attribute | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Role** | High-volume, internal system synchronization. The \"Spinal Cord.\" |\n| **Use Case** | Data Integrity |\n| **Example** | User updates their avatar in the Shell → Redis Event → CRM Service updates its cache → ERP Service updates its cache. |\n| **Why** | It is immutable, blazing fast, and ensures services stay decoupled. |\n\n### B. The Logic Layer: n8n (Self-Hosted)\n\n| Attribute | Description |\n|-------…290 chars truncated…n?**\n\n- **Visibility:** Analysts can visualize the business logic flow.\n- **Client Empowerment:** We can expose a restricted view to clients, allowing them to tweak their own automations (e.g., \"Change the alert email address\") without engineering involvement.\n\n### Event Flow Example\n\n```\n1. Bot Service finishes a conversation.\n2. Emits event: conversation.completed\n3. n8n catches event → Triggers \"Sentiment Analysis\" → Triggers \"Update CRM Record\"\n```\n\nThis allows us to add new automations **without touching the code of the core services**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Frontend Strategy: The \"Native PWA\" Feel\n\n**Objective:** Load instantly, transition seamlessly, never flash white.\n\n### A. The Technology Stack\n\n| Component | Technology |\n|-----------|------------|\n| **Host** | Astro (Server-Side Rendering + Client Router) |\n| **Micro-Apps** | React (bundled via Vite) |\n| **State** | Nano Stores (for cross-app UI signaling) |\n| **Data** | TanStack Query (for server-state synchronization) |\n\n### B. The Loading Strategy (Lazy Loading)\n\nWe do **not** bundle the ERP code with the CRM code.\n\n1. **Initial Load:** User downloads `shell.js` (~15kb). They see the Sidebar and Header immediately.\n2. **Interaction:** User clicks \"CRM\".\n3. **Hydration:** Astro's router intercepts the click. It fetches `chunk-crm.js` via `client:only=\"react\"` and mounts it into the content area.\n4. **Transition:** The Sidebar persists. The content area transitions smoothly.\n\n### C. Routing\n\n- Routes like `/crm/*` are Astro pages that mount a specific React Island (`<CrmApp />`).\n- **Error Boundaries:** If the CRM bundle fails to load, the Shell catches the error. The Sidebar remains functional, preventing a \"White Screen of Death.\"\n\n### D. Communication (The \"Store\" Pattern)\n\nApps do **not** talk directly to each other. They talk to a shared Nano Store.\n\n**Example:** CRM updates \"Lead Status\". It calls `notifications.add()`. The Shell (listening to `notifications`) shows a toast.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Backend Strategy & Observability\n\n**Objective:** Isolation and independent scaling.\n\n### A. Containerization\n\nEach folder in `/services/*` has its own `Dockerfile`.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- **Isolation:** If the `bot-processor` crashes due to a memory leak, the `erp-engine` keeps running perfectly.\n- **Scaling:** On Black Friday, we can spin up 50 replicas of `core-api` without paying for extra `bot-processor` instances.\n\n### B. Observability\n\n| Concern | Strategy |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Logging** | Centralized (e.g., Loki/CloudWatch). No `console.log` into the void. |\n| **Tracing** | We tag every request with a `correlation_id` at the API Gateway. This ID follows the request from Frontend → API → Redis → n8n → Database, allowing us to trace a user action across the entire distributed system. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Data Strategy (Multi-Tenancy)\n\n**Objective:** Logical separation on a shared physical resource.\n\n### A. Database Topology\n\nWe will use a **Single Physical Postgres Cluster** (e.g., Supabase) but enforce **Logical Schema Isolation**.\n\n```\nDatabase: business_os_db\n├── Schema: auth           # Supabase managed\n├── Schema: public         # Users, Organizations, Tenants\n├── Schema: crm_service    # Tables: leads, pipelines, activities\n└── Schema: erp_service    # Tables: ledgers, invoices, inventory\n```\n\n### B. Schema Ownership\n\n| Rule | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Strict Rule** | Only the CRM Service can write to `crm_schema`. |\n| **Migrations** | Managed per-service (e.g., Drizzle Kit for Node, Golang Migrate for Go). |\n\n### C. The \"Shared Contract\" (`/packages/ts-schema`)\n\nTo prevent chaos, **no service is allowed to \"guess\" the shape of data**.\n\nWe maintain a shared TypeScript package that exports the Types for every API response and Event payload.\n\n**Rule:** If you change the Database Schema, you **must** update the Shared Types.\n\n### D. Multi-Tenancy (RLS)\n\n| Rule | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Strict Rule** | Every single table in every schema **MUST** have an `organization_id` column. |\n| **Enforcement** | We use Postgres Row Level Security (RLS). |\n| **Mechanism** | The API Gateway passes the User's JWT to the database connection. Postgres itself ensures Customer A never sees Customer B's data, even if the developer makes a mistake in the SQL query. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Development Workflow\n\n### \"Day 1\" Setup\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone Repo\ngit clone https://github.com/your-org/business-os-monorepo.git\n\n# 2. Install Dependencies (Turborepo installs all dependencies for all apps)\nnpm install\n\n# 3. Start Infrastructure (Postgres, Redis, and Backend Services)\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# 4. Start Frontend (Astro Shell and React watchers)\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### \"Day 100\" Deployment\n\n| Layer | Platform |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Frontend** | Vercel / Netlify (Global Edge Network) |\n| **Backend** | AWS ECS / DigitalOcean Kubernetes (Docker Containers) |\n| **Database** | Supabase / AWS RDS |\n\n---\n\n## 9.

{"timestamp":"2025-11-24T23:59:21.317Z","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"agent_message","message":"Here’s the dent I’d make with this repo:\n\n**What We’re Building Today**\n\nWe should build a single, end‑to‑end “Lead Inbox” vertical slice for the CRM:\n\n- A unified, real‑time inbox where sales sees every new lead entering the business (site forms, WhatsApp bot, manual entries) in one place.\n- A lead detail view with a time‑ordered “timeline” of events (messages, status changes, invoices, automations).\n- A small but real workflow: a WhatsApp conversation becomes a lead, gets qualified, then hands off to invoicing.\n\nThis is not “just a CRM screen.” It’s the first slice that forces the entire Business OS architecture to prove itself under real user pressure.\n\n---\n\n**Why This Is The Only Sensible First Slice**\n\n- **It exercises every major layer**: Shell routing, React micro‑app, API gateway, core CRM service, bot processor, Redis/n8n events, and multi‑tenant data. Nothing else gives this much architectural coverage with so little surface area.\n- **It validates the “Nervous System” idea**: A bot conversation becomes an event; n8n reacts; CRM updates without tight coupling. If this feels smooth, your whole events‑first strategy is justified.\n- **It aligns with the roadmap**: You’re already targeting CRM MVP + Core API + WhatsApp Bot. This slice is the intersection of those, not a side quest.\n- **It defines the canonical object of the system**: The “lead” becomes the first true cross‑service entity: marketing touches it, sales lives in it, ERP bills it, bots converse with it.\n- **It gives users an immediate “aha”**: A rep opens the app, sees all live conversations and leads in one focused inbox, and never has to alt‑tab between tools again. That’s your tab‑fatigue story made visceral.\n\n---\n\n**Experience First: How It Feels**\n\n- The rep opens the Shell. The sidebar and header snap in instantly; there’s a “Leads” item showing a small live counter.\n- Clicking “Leads” loads the CRM micro‑app into the content area, but the shell never blinks. The inbox appears: each row shows lead name, source (WhatsApp, web, manual), last message, owner, and status.\n- A WhatsApp message arrives. Without refresh, a new row slides in at the top with a subtle pulse animation: “New from WhatsApp · Unassigned.”\n- The rep clicks the row. The right pane shows the full conversation transcript, structured lead info, and a timeline: `conversation.started`, `message.user`, `message.bot`, `lead.created`.\n- One click: “Qualify as Opportunity.” Behind the scenes that emits a `crm.lead.status_updated` event; n8n can now branch into “notify AE,” “create draft invoice,” or “schedule follow‑up”—without touching the CRM code.\n- The rep never thinks “I’m using a CRM plus a bot plus workflows.” They just feel like they’re in one living system.\n\n---\n\n**Architecture Sketch (Vertical Slice)**\n\n- **Shell (Astro)**\n  - New route: `/crm/inbox` mounting the CRM micro‑app as a React island.\n  - Shell owns layout, auth, and global UI state (e.g., active organization, basic notifications).\n  - It only knows “There is a CRM app that renders here,” not how leads work.\n\n- **CRM Micro‑App (React, Vite library)**\n  - `LeadInboxPage` – fetches paginated leads for the current org; supports simple filters (`status`, `source`, `owner`).\n  - `LeadRow` – visual, keyboard‑navigable representation of a lead in the list.\n  - `LeadDetailPane` – shows core fields plus the event timeline.\n  - `ActivityComposer` – add notes, change status, assign owner, schedule tasks (each action emits events).\n  - All data access goes through a small `crmClient` that talks to the API gateway, typed via shared schema.\n\n- **Shared Contract (ts-schema)**\n  - `Lead` type: identity, org, status, source, routing fields.\n  - `LeadEvent` union: `lead.created`, `lead.updated`, `conversation.message`, `conversation.completed`, `task.created`.\n  - `BotConversation` type: messages, channel, linkage to lead.\n  - This is the “single source of type truth” for CRM, bot, and workflows.\n\n- **Core API / CRM Service**\n  - REST or RPC surface:\n    - `GET /crm/leads`, `GET /crm/leads/:id`, `GET /crm/leads/:id/events`\n    - `POST /crm/leads`, `PATCH /crm/leads/:id`\n    - `POST /crm/leads/:id/events` for user‑initiated actions (notes, status changes).\n  - Every query is implicitly scoped by `organization_id` from the JWT; Postgres RLS enforces tenant isolation.\n  - Emits `LeadEvent` into Redis Streams on mutating operations.\n\n- **Bot Processor + Events + n8n**\n  - Bot finishes or reaches a defined threshold (“high intent”) → emits `conversation.completed` into Redis with payload typed by `ts-schema`.\n  - n8n catches that event, runs business logic (e.g., enrichment, auto‑tagging), and finally emits `lead.created` or `lead.updated` back into the CRM stream.\n  - CRM service listens to relevant Redis streams, materializes leads and events into its schema—no direct bot → CRM coupling.\n\n- **Frontend Sync**\n  - TanStack Query fetches lead list and timelines.\n  - Optional: server‑sent events or WebSocket channel to push new `LeadEvent`s into the inbox and timeline, stitched via the `id` fields in the shared contract.\n\n---\n\n**Design Principles Baked In**\n\n- **Think Different**: We don’t “build a CRM module.” We build a narrative spine—Lead Inbox + Timeline—that all future modules (marketing, ERP, bots) can hang their events onto.\n- **Obsess Over Details**: The illusion of one app (no white flashes, preserved sidebar, optimistic UI for status changes) is what sells the “Business OS” vision, not the framework logos.\n- **Simplify Ruthlessly**: One core object (`Lead`), one primary screen (`Inbox` + `Detail`), one primary workflow (qualify a bot‑generated lead). Max power, minimal surface.\n\n---\n\n**Where You Can Point Me Next**\n\nPick the axis you care about most for the next step, and I’ll go deep:\n\n- **Data contract** – precise `Lead` / `LeadEvent` / `BotConversation` schemas and how they map to Postgres tables and RLS.\n- **Frontend architecture** – component boundaries, state management, and API layer for the CRM micro‑app.\n- **Event taxonomy & n8n flows** – the minimal but extensible set of events and workflows that make this slice sing.\n- **UX flows** – detailed, screen‑by‑screen narrative of the Lead Inbox interactions.\n\nTell me which dimension you want to design first, and we’ll sharpen this slice until it feels inevitable."}}

{"timestamp":"2025-11-24T23:59:21.335Z","type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"output_text","text":"Here’s the dent I’d make with this repo:\n\n**What We’re Building Today**\n\nWe should build a single, end‑to‑end “Lead Inbox” vertical slice for the CRM:\n\n- A unified, real‑time inbox where sales sees every new lead entering the business (site forms, WhatsApp bot, manual entries) in one place.\n- A lead detail view with a time‑ordered “timeline” of events (messages, status changes, invoices, automations).\n- A small but real workflow: a WhatsApp conversation becomes a lead, gets qualified, then hands off to invoicing.\n\nThis is not “just a CRM screen.” It’s the first slice that forces the entire Business OS architecture to prove itself under real user pressure.\n\n---\n\n**Why This Is The Only Sensible First Slice**\n\n- **It exercises every major layer**: Shell routing, React micro‑app, API gateway, core CRM service, bot processor, Redis/n8n events, and multi‑tenant data. Nothing else gives this much architectural coverage with so little surface area.\n- **It validates the “Nervous System” idea**: A bot conversation becomes an event; n8n reacts; CRM updates without tight coupling. If this feels smooth, your whole events‑first strategy is justified.\n- **It aligns with the roadmap**: You’re already targeting CRM MVP + Core API + WhatsApp Bot. This slice is the intersection of those, not a side quest.\n- **It defines the canonical object of the system**: The “lead” becomes the first true cross‑service entity: marketing touches it, sales lives in it, ERP bills it, bots converse with it.\n- **It gives users an immediate “aha”**: A rep opens the app, sees all live conversations and leads in one focused inbox, and never has to alt‑tab between tools again. That’s your tab‑fatigue story made visceral.\n\n---\n\n**Experience First: How It Feels**\n\n- The rep opens the Shell. The sidebar and header snap in instantly; there’s a “Leads” item showing a small live counter.\n- Clicking “Leads” loads the CRM micro‑app into the content area, but the shell never blinks. The inbox appears: each row shows lead name, source (WhatsApp, web, manual), last message, owner, and status.\n- A WhatsApp message arrives. Without refresh, a new row slides in at the top with a subtle pulse animation: “New from WhatsApp · Unassigned.”\n- The rep clicks the row. The right pane shows the full conversation transcript, structured lead info, and a timeline: `conversation.started`, `message.user`, `message.bot`, `lead.created`.\n- One click: “Qualify as Opportunity.” Behind the scenes that emits a `crm.lead.status_updated` event; n8n can now branch into “notify AE,” “create draft invoice,” or “schedule follow‑up”—without touching the CRM code.\n- The rep never thinks “I’m using a CRM plus a bot plus workflows.” They just feel like they’re in one living system.\n\n---\n\n**Architecture Sketch (Vertical Slice)**\n\n- **Shell (Astro)**\n  - New route: `/crm/inbox` mounting the CRM micro‑app as a React island.\n  - Shell owns layout, auth, and global UI state (e.g., active organization, basic notifications).\n  - It only knows “There is a CRM app that renders here,” not how leads work.\n\n- **CRM Micro‑App (React, Vite library)**\n  - `LeadInboxPage` – fetches paginated leads for the current org; supports simple filters (`status`, `source`, `owner`).\n  - `LeadRow` – visual, keyboard‑navigable representation of a lead in the list.\n  - `LeadDetailPane` – shows core fields plus the event timeline.\n  - `ActivityComposer` – add notes, change status, assign owner, schedule tasks (each action emits events).\n  - All data access goes through a small `crmClient` that talks to the API gateway, typed via shared schema.\n\n- **Shared Contract (ts-schema)**\n  - `Lead` type: identity, org, status, source, routing fields.\n  - `LeadEvent` union: `lead.created`, `lead.updated`, `conversation.message`, `conversation.completed`, `task.created`.\n  - `BotConversation` type: messages, channel, linkage to lead.\n  - This is the “single source of type truth” for CRM, bot, and workflows.\n\n- **Core API / CRM Service**\n  - REST or RPC surface:\n    - `GET /crm/leads`, `GET /crm/leads/:id`, `GET /crm/leads/:id/events`\n    - `POST /crm/leads`, `PATCH /crm/leads/:id`\n    - `POST /crm/leads/:id/events` for user‑initiated actions (notes, status changes).\n  - Every query is implicitly scoped by `organization_id` from the JWT; Postgres RLS enforces tenant isolation.\n  - Emits `LeadEvent` into Redis Streams on mutating operations.\n\n- **Bot Processor + Events + n8n**\n  - Bot finishes or reaches a defined threshold (“high intent”) → emits `conversation.completed` into Redis with payload typed by `ts-schema`.\n  - n8n catches that event, runs business logic (e.g., enrichment, auto‑tagging), and finally emits `lead.created` or `lead.updated` back into the CRM stream.\n  - CRM service listens to relevant Redis streams, materializes leads and events into its schema—no direct bot → CRM coupling.\n\n- **Frontend Sync**\n  - TanStack Query fetches lead list and timelines.\n  - Optional: server‑sent events or WebSocket channel to push new `LeadEvent`s into the inbox and timeline, stitched via the `id` fields in the shared contract.\n\n---\n\n**Design Principles Baked In**\n\n- **Think Different**: We don’t “build a CRM module.” We build a narrative spine—Lead Inbox + Timeline—that all future modules (marketing, ERP, bots) can hang their events onto.\n- **Obsess Over Details**: The illusion of one app (no white flashes, preserved sidebar, optimistic UI for status changes) is what sells the “Business OS” vision, not the framework logos.\n- **Simplify Ruthlessly**: One core object (`Lead`), one primary screen (`Inbox` + `Detail`), one primary workflow (qualify a bot‑generated lead). Max power, minimal surface.\n\n---\n\n**Where You Can Point Me Next**\n\nPick the axis you care about most for the next step, and I’ll go deep:\n\n- **Data contract** – precise `Lead` / `LeadEvent` / `BotConversation` schemas and how they map to Postgres tables and RLS.\n- **Frontend architecture** – component boundaries, state management, and API layer for the CRM micro‑app.\n- **Event taxonomy & n8n flows** – the minimal but extensible set of events and workflows that make this slice sing.\n- **UX flows** – detailed, screen‑by‑screen narrative of the Lead Inbox interactions.\n\nTell me which dimension you want to design first, and we’ll sharpen this slice until it feels inevitable."}]}}

In Other words:\n\n# Unison – Brand Guidelines (v0.1)\n\n> Working name: **Unison**  \n> These guidelines describe the brand foundations for the Business OS project.  \n> If the project is renamed later, treat \"Unison\" as a placeholder and update accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Brand Core\n\n### 1.1 One-Liner\n\n> **Unison is the operating system for small businesses and agencies, unifying CRM, ERP, billing, and AI automations into one calm, native-feeling workspace.**\n\n### 1.2 Elevator Pitch\n\nMost small businesses run on a mess of tools: spreadsheets, WhatsApp, CRM, invoicing apps, manual reminders.\n\nUnison replaces that chaos with a single operating system:\n\n- A unified **app shell** that feels like a native desktop app.\n- Modular **apps** for CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots.\n- An invisible **event system** that keeps everything in sync across the business.\n\nResult: Teams work in one place, on one source of truth, at a sustainable rhythm.\n\n### 1.3 Brand Promise\n\n> **\"Bring your business tools into unison, and run everything from one place.\"**\n\n### 1.4 Brand Pillars\n\n1. **Unity** – One shell, one data model, one workspace.\n2. **Calm Control** – Clear dashboards, predictable systems, no drama.\n3. **Visible Automation** – Bots and workflows that explain what they did and why.\n4. **Real-World Ready** – Handles invoices, ledgers, permissions, and multi-tenant reality.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Brand Personality\n\nIf Unison were a person, it would be:\n\n- **Analytical but human** – understands workflows and numbers, but speaks plainly.\n- **Calm and composed** – no hype, no panic, just steady progress.\n- **Quietly powerful** – does heavy lifting behind the scenes, without showing off.\n- **Trustworthy and transparent** – automation is explainable, not magic.\n\nAvoid personalities like:\n\n- The loud “growth hacker” promising to 10x everything overnight.\n- The jargon-heavy consultant who hides simple ideas behind complex language.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Voice & Tone\n\n### 3.1 Principles\n\n1. **Plain, clear English**  \n   - Write for busy operators and owners.\n   - Short sentences. Concrete nouns. Few buzzwords.\n\n2. **Confident, not arrogant**  \n   - We know what we’re doing, but we don’t promise miracles.\n   - Say: “Unison reduces errors and copy-paste work,” not “eliminates all problems forever.”\n\n3. **Calm and reassuring**  \n   - Focus on stability, consistency, and clarity.\n   - Avoid fear tactics and fake urgency.\n\n4. **Localization-friendly**  \n   - Use language that will translate cleanly later.\n   - Avoid idioms and jokes that only make sense in one culture.\n\n### 3.2 Writing Examples\n\n**Good (homepage hero):**\n\n> Run your business from one workspace.  \n> Unison connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots so your team always works in sync.\n\n**Bad (too hype):**\n\n> Smash chaos with our AI super-suite and 10x your growth in a week!\n\n**Good (feature explanation):**\n\n> When a deal is marked as won, Unison can create the project, schedule tasks, and issue the invoice.  \n> You can see every step in the automation log.\n\n**Bad (too vague / magical):**\n\n> Our AI takes care of everything behind the scenes. Just sit back and relax.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Visual Identity (v0.1)\n\nThese are starting points for design; they will evolve with real UI work.\n\n### 4.1 Color Direction\n\nConcept: **Orchestrated calm.**\n\n- **Base:** Deep neutral (charcoal / ink) for backgrounds or major chrome.\n- **Primary accent:** A modern blue or teal that suggests clarity and flow.\n- **Secondary accents:** Soft gradients or subtle secondary colors for CRM vs ERP vs Bots.\n\nUsage:\n\n- Use color to signal **state** (success, warning, error) and **hierarchy**, not decoration.\n- Each core module can lean on a slightly different accent shade while keeping the overall look cohesive.\n\n### 4.2 Typography\n\nGoals:\n\n- Highly legible for tables, metrics, and forms.\n- Works across many locales and screen sizes.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- **Headings:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar).\n- **Body text:** Same family, regular weight, 14–16px for readability.\n\nRules:\n\n- Keep titles short and scannable.\n- Avoid over-styling; let whitespace and hierarchy do most of the work.\n\n### 4.3 Iconography & Illustration\n\n- Icons should be simple and consistent, ideally line-based or minimal solid icons.\n- Avoid cartoon mascots and over-cute elements.\n- If using illustrations, prefer abstract representations of flows, nodes, or grids rather than generic “businesspeople with laptops.”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Product UX Principles\n\n1. **One Shell, Many Apps**  \n   - The sidebar and header are stable anchors across CRM, ERP, Billing, and Bots.\n   - Switching between modules should feel like changing panels, not switching websites.\n\n2. **Keep Context With the User**  \n   - From any client record, you should be able to see related deals, invoices, tasks, and automations without opening five tabs.\n\n3. **Explain Automations**  \n   - Every automated action (sending an invoice, updating a status, posting a message) should be visible and traceable.\n   - Provide an “automation log” or similar view.\n\n4. **Multi-Tenant Safety by Design**  \n   - Make organization boundaries obvious.\n   - Never make it easy to confuse data between orgs or clients.\n\n5. **Design for Everyday Use, Not Demos**  \n   - Optimize for the daily workflows of small agencies and businesses:\n     - Lead → quote → project → invoice → payment.\n   - Fancy dashboards are secondary to clean, efficient flows.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Naming System (Modules & Sub-Brands)\n\nAssuming **Unison** as master brand:\n\n- **Platform:** Unison OS\n- **Modules:**\n  - **Unison CRM** – Leads, pipelines, activities, deals.\n  - **Unison ERP** – Invoices, ledgers, inventory, suppliers.\n  - **Unison Billing** – Subscriptions, one-off invoices, payment status.\n  - **Unison Bots** – AI assistants, chatbots, workflow automations.\n  - **Unison Core** – Auth, organizations, users, plans, multi-tenancy.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n- Use full module names in documentation and marketing.\n- Inside the app, you can shorten to **CRM**, **ERP**, **Billing**, **Bots**, **Core** once users are oriented.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Example Taglines & Messaging\n\nShort taglines:\n\n- “Bring your business tools into unison.”\n- “One operating system for your whole business.”\n- “From lead to invoice, in one flow.”\n\nHomepage hero example:\n\n> **Run your business in unison.**  \n> Unison OS connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots in a single workspace, so your team always works from the same source of truth.\n\nSubheading example:\n\n> No more switching apps or copying data by hand.  \n> See every client, project, and invoice in one place, with automations you can trust and understand.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Out of Scope (What Unison Is Not)\n\n- Not a generic task or note-taking app.\n- Not a “growth hack” dashboard.\n- Not just an integration layer that tapes together other tools.\n- Not limited to one country or language; English-first, translation-ready.\n\nUnison is built as **infrastructure for small businesses and agencies**: multi-tenant, schema-based, event-driven.  \nThe brand should feel as solid and coherent as the architecture."}]}}

In Other words:\n+\n+  # Unison – Brand Guidelines (v0.1)\n+\n+  > Working name: **Unison**  \n+  > These guidelines describe the brand foundations for the Business OS project.  \n+  > If the project is renamed later, treat \"Unison\" as a placeholder and update accordingly.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 1. Brand Core\n+\n+  ### 1.1 One-Liner\n+\n+  > **Unison is the operating system for small businesses and agencies, unifying CRM, ERP, billing, and AI automations into one calm, native-feeling workspace.**\n+\n+  ### 1.2 Elevator Pitch\n+\n+  Most small businesses run on a mess of tools: spreadsheets, WhatsApp, CRM, invoicing apps, manual reminders.\n+\n+  Unison replaces that chaos with a single operating system:\n+\n+  - A unified **app shell** that feels like a native desktop app.\n+  - Modular **apps** for CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots.\n+  - An invisible **event system** that keeps everything in sync across the business.\n+\n+  Result: Teams work in one place, on one source of truth, at a sustainable rhythm.\n+\n+  ### 1.3 Brand Promise\n+\n+  > **\"Bring your business tools into unison, and run everything from one place.\"**\n+\n+  ### 1.4 Brand Pillars\n+\n+  1. **Unity** – One shell, one data model, one workspace.\n+  2. **Calm Control** – Clear dashboards, predictable systems, no drama.\n+  3. **Visible Automation** – Bots and workflows that explain what they did and why.\n+  4. **Real-World Ready** – Handles invoices, ledgers, permissions, and multi-tenant reality.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 2. Brand Personality\n+\n+  If Unison were a person, it would be:\n+\n+  - **Analytical but human** – understands workflows and numbers, but speaks plainly.\n+  - **Calm and composed** – no hype, no panic, just steady progress.\n+  - **Quietly powerful** – does heavy lifting behind the scenes, without showing off.\n+  - **Trustworthy and transparent** – automation is explainable, not magic.\n+\n+  Avoid personalities like:\n+\n+  - The loud “growth hacker” promising to 10x everything overnight.\n+  - The jargon-heavy consultant who hides simple ideas behind complex language.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 3. Voice & Tone\n+\n+  ### 3.1 Principles\n+\n+  1. **Plain, clear English**  \n+     - Write for busy operators and owners.\n+     - Short sentences. Concrete nouns. Few buzzwords.\n+\n+  2. **Confident, not arrogant**  \n+     - We know what we’re doing, but we don’t promise miracles.\n+     - Say: “Unison reduces errors and copy-paste work,” not “eliminates all problems forever.”\n+\n+  3. **Calm and reassuring**  \n+     - Focus on stability, consistency, and clarity.\n+     - Avoid fear tactics and fake urgency.\n+\n+  4. **Localization-friendly**  \n+     - Use language that will translate cleanly later.\n+     - Avoid idioms and jokes that only make sense in one culture.\n+\n+  ### 3.2 Writing Examples\n+\n+  **Good (homepage hero):**\n+\n+  > Run your business from one workspace.  \n+  > Unison connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots so your team always works in sync.\n+\n+  **Bad (too hype):**\n+\n+  > Smash chaos with our AI super-suite and 10x your growth in a week!\n+\n+  **Good (feature explanation):**\n+\n+  > When a deal is marked as won, Unison can create the project, schedule tasks, and issue the invoice.  \n+  > You can see every step in the automation log.\n+\n+  **Bad (too vague / magical):**\n+\n+  > Our AI takes care of everything behind the scenes. Just sit back and relax.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 4. Visual Identity (v0.1)\n+\n+  These are starting points for design; they will evolve with real UI work.\n+\n+  ### 4.1 Color Direction\n+\n+  Concept: **Orchestrated calm.**\n+\n+  - **Base:** Deep neutral (charcoal / ink) for backgrounds or major chrome.\n+  - **Primary accent:** A modern blue or teal that suggests clarity and flow.\n+  - **Secondary accents:** Soft gradients or subtle secondary colors for CRM vs ERP vs Bots.\n+\n+  Usage:\n+\n+  - Use color to signal **state** (success, warning, error) and **hierarchy**, not decoration.\n+  - Each core module can lean on a slightly different accent shade while keeping the overall look cohesive.\n+\n+  ### 4.2 Typography\n+\n+  Goals:\n+\n+  - Highly legible for tables, metrics, and forms.\n+  - Works across many locales and screen sizes.\n+\n+  Suggestions:\n+\n+  - **Headings:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar).\n+  - **Body text:** Same family, regular weight, 14–16px for readability.\n+\n+  Rules:\n+\n+  - Keep titles short and scannable.\n+  - Avoid over-styling; let whitespace and hierarchy do most of the work.\n+\n+  ### 4.3 Iconography & Illustration\n+\n+  - Icons should be simple and consistent, ideally line-based or minimal solid icons.\n+  - Avoid cartoon mascots and over-cute elements.\n+  - If using illustrations, prefer abstract representations of flows, nodes, or grids rather than generic “businesspeople with laptops.”\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 5. Product UX Principles\n+\n+  1. **One Shell, Many Apps**  \n+     - The sidebar and header are stable anchors across CRM, ERP, Billing, and Bots.\n+     - Switching between modules should feel like changing panels, not switching websites.\n+\n+  2. **Keep Context With the User**  \n+     - From any client record, you should be able to see related deals, invoices, tasks, and automations without opening five tabs.\n+\n+  3. **Explain Automations**  \n+     - Every automated action (sending an invoice, updating a status, posting a message) should be visible and traceable.\n+     - Provide an “automation log” or similar view.\n+\n+  4. **Multi-Tenant Safety by Design**  \n+     - Make organization boundaries obvious.\n+     - Never make it easy to confuse data between orgs or clients.\n+\n+  5. **Design for Everyday Use, Not Demos**  \n+     - Optimize for the daily workflows of small agencies and businesses:\n+       - Lead → quote → project → invoice → payment.\n+     - Fancy dashboards are secondary to clean, efficient flows.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 6. Naming System (Modules & Sub-Brands)\n+\n+  Assuming **Unison** as master brand:\n+\n+  - **Platform:** Unison OS\n+  - **Modules:**\n+    - **Unison CRM** – Leads, pipelines, activities, deals.\n+    - **Unison ERP** – Invoices, ledgers, inventory, suppliers.\n+    - **Unison Billing** – Subscriptions, one-off invoices, payment status.\n+    - **Unison Bots** – AI assistants, chatbots, workflow automations.\n+    - **Unison Core** – Auth, organizations, users, plans, multi-tenancy.\n+\n+  Guidelines:\n+\n+  - Use full module names in documentation and marketing.\n+  - Inside the app, you can shorten to **CRM**, **ERP**, **Billing**, **Bots**, **Core** once users are oriented.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 7. Example Taglines & Messaging\n+\n+  Short taglines:\n+\n+  - “Bring your business tools into unison.”\n+  - “One operating system for your whole business.”\n+  - “From lead to invoice, in one flow.”\n+\n+  Homepage hero example:\n+\n+  > **Run your business in unison.**  \n+  > Unison OS connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots in a single workspace, so your team always works from the same source of truth.\n+\n+  Subheading example:\n+\n+  > No more switching apps or copying data by hand.  \n+  > See every client, project, and invoice in one place, with automations you can trust and understand.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 8. Out of Scope (What Unison Is Not)\n+\n+  - Not a generic task or note-taking app.\n+  - Not a “growth hack” dashboard.\n+  - Not just an integration layer that tapes together other tools.\n+  - Not limited to one country or language; English-first, translation-ready.\n+\n+  Unison is built as **infrastructure for small businesses and agencies**: multi-tenant, schema-based, event-driven.  \n+  The brand should feel as solid and coherent as the architecture.\n*** End Patch"}}

I’ll show an enhanced version; you decide whether it replaces the current section.\n\n---\n\n**Enhanced Version – First Principles Pass**\n\n```markdown\n# Unison – Brand Guidelines (v0.2, First Principles Draft)\n\n> Working name: **Unison**  \n> If the project is renamed later, treat \"Unison\" as a placeholder and update accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Brand Core\n\n### 1.1 Problem From First Principles\n\n- Small businesses and agencies run on **workflows**, not tools: lead → quote → project → invoice → payment → reporting.\n- Today those workflows are split across **unrelated SaaS tools**, ad-hoc spreadsheets, and messaging apps (often WhatsApp).\n- The real pain is not “missing features” but:\n  - **Fragmented state** (no single source of truth),\n  - **Manual glue work** (copy/paste, exports, screenshots),\n  - **Invisible automations** (things happen but nobody knows how or why).\n- Owners care about **control and clarity** more than “AI magic.”\n- Any solution that doesn’t respect **multi-tenant reality, accounting correctness, and permissions** will be rejected in practice.\n\n### 1.2 First-Principles Solution\n\nFrom those fundamentals:\n\n- Unison is **not** “just another CRM or ERP.”\n- Unison is:\n  - A **unified shell**: one calm workspace instead of ten tabs.\n  - A **consistent data model**: clients, projects, invoices, and conversations all line up.\n  - An **event-driven backbone**: everything important (a deal closing, an invoice being paid, a bot sending a message) is an explicit event.\n  - A **visible automation layer**: workflows are inspectable, explainable, and correctable.\n\n> **Unison is the operating system for small businesses and agencies: one workspace, one data model, and one automation layer for the flows that actually run the business.**\n\n### 1.3 Refined One-Liner\n\n> **Run your whole business from one calm workspace – Unison connects CRM, ERP, billing, and AI automations into a single operating system for small teams and agencies.**\n\n### 1.4 Refined Elevator Pitch\n\nMost small businesses and agencies don’t suffer from a lack of tools; they suffer from tools that don’t agree with each other.\n\nLeads live in one app, invoices in another, tasks in a third, and critical decisions happen in WhatsApp threads and owner memory.\n\nUnison starts from a different premise:\n\n- The business has a **small number of critical flows** that must always work: from first contact to paid invoice.\n- Those flows deserve **one operating system**, not a chain of brittle integrations.\n\nWith Unison:\n\n- The team works in a **single shell** that feels like a native desktop app, not a pile of tabs.\n- CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots are **modules** on a shared data model and event system.\n- Every automation—whether it’s creating an invoice, updating a status, or sending a reminder—is **logged and explainable**.\n\nResult: operators get calm, predictable control; owners get a trustworthy picture of the business; AI becomes infrastructure, not a gimmick.\n\n### 1.5 Brand Promise\n\n> **“Bring your business tools into unison, and run every critical flow from one place.”**\n\n### 1.6 Brand Pillars (Tightened)\n\n1. **Unity of Workflows** – From lead to invoice, flows live in one system, on one schema.\n2. **Calm Control** – No drama: clear states, predictable automations, stable UI.\n3. **Visible Automation** – Every automated action is logged, explainable, and overridable.\n4. **Operational Reality** – Built for multi-tenant ledgers, permissions, and real-world constraints from day one.\n5. **Localization-Ready** – Copy, UX, and data model are designed to work across languages and markets.\n\n---\n\n## 2–8 (Personality, Voice & Tone, Visual Identity, UX Principles, Naming, Taglines, Out-of-Scope)\n\nYour existing sections here are strong and largely consistent with the refined core above.  \nWhen we update the doc, we will:\n\n- Keep their overall structure (Personality, Voice & Tone, Visuals, UX Principles, Naming, Taglines, Out-of-Scope).\n- Align terminology and examples with the refined **problem/solution** framing and the “flows, not tools” language.\n```\n\n---\n\nWould you like to **apply this enhanced version** of the Brand Core section (v0.2 First Principles) to the document?\n\n- Reply **`y`** to adopt this enhanced version (I’ll update the stored content accordingly).  \n- Reply **`n`** to keep your original and discard this proposal.  \n- Or give specific instructions (e.g., “keep 1.1 and 1.2 only, keep my original 2–8 as-is”).\n\nAfter your choice, I’ll re-open the advanced options menu (1–5, r, x) so we can keep refining or exit elicitation."}}

I’ll show an enhanced version; you decide whether it replaces the current section.\n\n---\n\n**Enhanced Version – First Principles Pass**\n\n```markdown\n# Unison – Brand Guidelines (v0.2, First Principles Draft)\n\n> Working name: **Unison**  \n> If the project is renamed later, treat \"Unison\" as a placeholder and update accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Brand Core\n\n### 1.1 Problem From First Principles\n\n- Small businesses and agencies run on **workflows**, not tools: lead → quote → project → invoice → payment → reporting.\n- Today those workflows are split across **unrelated SaaS tools**, ad-hoc spreadsheets, and messaging apps (often WhatsApp).\n- The real pain is not “missing features” but:\n  - **Fragmented state** (no single source of truth),\n  - **Manual glue work** (copy/paste, exports, screenshots),\n  - **Invisible automations** (things happen but nobody knows how or why).\n- Owners care about **control and clarity** more than “AI magic.”\n- Any solution that doesn’t respect **multi-tenant reality, accounting correctness, and permissions** will be rejected in practice.\n\n### 1.2 First-Principles Solution\n\nFrom those fundamentals:\n\n- Unison is **not** “just another CRM or ERP.”\n- Unison is:\n  - A **unified shell**: one calm workspace instead of ten tabs.\n  - A **consistent data model**: clients, projects, invoices, and conversations all line up.\n  - An **event-driven backbone**: everything important (a deal closing, an invoice being paid, a bot sending a message) is an explicit event.\n  - A **visible automation layer**: workflows are inspectable, explainable, and correctable.\n\n> **Unison is the operating system for small businesses and agencies: one workspace, one data model, and one automation layer for the flows that actually run the business.**\n\n### 1.3 Refined One-Liner\n\n> **Run your whole business from one calm workspace – Unison connects CRM, ERP, billing, and AI automations into a single operating system for small teams and agencies.**\n\n### 1.4 Refined Elevator Pitch\n\nMost small businesses and agencies don’t suffer from a lack of tools; they suffer from tools that don’t agree with each other.\n\nLeads live in one app, invoices in another, tasks in a third, and critical decisions happen in WhatsApp threads and owner memory.\n\nUnison starts from a different premise:\n\n- The business has a **small number of critical flows** that must always work: from first contact to paid invoice.\n- Those flows deserve **one operating system**, not a chain of brittle integrations.\n\nWith Unison:\n\n- The team works in a **single shell** that feels like a native desktop app, not a pile of tabs.\n- CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots are **modules** on a shared data model and event system.\n- Every automation—whether it’s creating an invoice, updating a status, or sending a reminder—is **logged and explainable**.\n\nResult: operators get calm, predictable control; owners get a trustworthy picture of the business; AI becomes infrastructure, not a gimmick.\n\n### 1.5 Brand Promise\n\n> **“Bring your business tools into unison, and run every critical flow from one place.”**\n\n### 1.6 Brand Pillars (Tightened)\n\n1. **Unity of Workflows** – From lead to invoice, flows live in one system, on one schema.\n2. **Calm Control** – No drama: clear states, predictable automations, stable UI.\n3. **Visible Automation** – Every automated action is logged, explainable, and overridable.\n4. **Operational Reality** – Built for multi-tenant ledgers, permissions, and real-world constraints from day one.\n5. **Localization-Ready** – Copy, UX, and data model are designed to work across languages and markets.\n\n---\n\n## 2–8 (Personality, Voice & Tone, Visual Identity, UX Principles, Naming, Taglines, Out-of-Scope)\n\nYour existing sections here are strong and largely consistent with the refined core above.  \nWhen we update the doc, we will:\n\n- Keep their overall structure (Personality, Voice & Tone, Visuals, UX Principles, Naming, Taglines, Out-of-Scope).\n- Align terminology and examples with the refined **problem/solution** framing and the “flows, not tools” language.\n```\n\n---\n\nWould you like to **apply this enhanced version** of the Brand Core section (v0.2 First Principles) to the document?\n\n- Reply **`y`** to adopt this enhanced version (I’ll update the stored content accordingly).  \n- Reply **`n`** to keep your original and discard this proposal.  \n- Or give specific instructions (e.g., “keep 1.1 and 1.2 only, keep my original 2–8 as-is”).\n\nAfter your choice, I’ll re-open the advanced options menu (1–5, r, x) so we can keep refining or exit elicitation."}]}}

Brand Personality\n-\n-  If Unison were a person, it would be:\n-\n-  - **Analytical but human** – understands workflows and numbers, but speaks plainly.\n-  - **Calm and composed** – no hype, no panic, just steady progress.\n-  - **Quietly powerful** – does heavy lifting behind the scenes, without showing off.\n-  - **Trustworthy and transparent** – automation is explainable, not magic.\n-\n-  Avoid personalities like:\n-\n-  - The loud “growth hacker” promising to 10x everything overnight.\n-  - The jargon-heavy consultant who hides simple ideas behind complex language.\n-\n-  ---\n-\n-  ## 3. Voice & Tone\n-\n-  ### 3.1 Principles\n-\n-  1. **Plain, clear English**  \n-     - Write for busy operators and owners.\n-     - Short sentences. Concrete nouns. Few buzzwords.\n-\n-  2. **Confident, not arrogant**  \n-     - We know what we’re doing, but we don’t promise miracles.\n-     - Say: “Unison reduces errors and copy-paste work,” not “eliminates all problems forever.”\n-\n-  3. **Calm and reassuring**  \n-     - Focus on stability, consistency, and clarity.\n-     - Avoid fear tactics and fake urgency.\n-\n-  4. **Localization-friendly**  \n-     - Use language that will translate cleanly later.\n-     - Avoid idioms and jokes that only make sense in one culture.\n-\n-  ### 3.2 Writing Examples\n-\n-  **Good (homepage hero):**\n-\n-  > Run your business from one workspace.  \n-  > Unison connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots so your team always works in sync.\n-\n-  **Bad (too hype):**\n-\n-  > Smash chaos with our AI super-suite and 10x your growth in a week!\n-\n-  **Good (feature explanation):**\n-\n-  > When a deal is marked as won, Unison can create the project, schedule tasks, and issue the invoice.  \n-  > You can see every step in the automation log.\n-\n-  **Bad (too vague / magical):**\n-\n-  > Our AI takes care of everything behind the scenes. Just sit back and relax.\n-\n-  ---\n-\n-  ## 4. Visual Identity (v0.1)\n-\n-  These are starting points for design; they will evolve with real UI work.\n-\n-  ### 4.1 Color Direction\n-\n-  Concept: **Orchestrated calm.**\n-\n-  - **Base:** Deep neutral (charcoal / ink) for backgrounds or major chrome.\n-  - **Primary accent:** A modern blue or teal that suggests clarity and flow.\n-  - **Secondary accents:** Soft gradients or subtle secondary colors for CRM vs ERP vs Bots.\n-\n-  Usage:\n-\n-  - Use color to signal **state** (success, warning, error) and **hierarchy**, not decoration.\n-  - Each core module can lean on a slightly different accent shade while keeping the overall look cohesive.\n-\n-  ### 4.2 Typography\n-\n-  Goals:\n-\n-  - Highly legible for tables, metrics, and forms.\n-  - Works across many locales and screen sizes.\n-\n-  Suggestions:\n-\n-  - **Headings:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar).\n-  - **Body text:** Same family, regular weight, 14–16px for readability.\n-\n-  Rules:\n-\n-  - Keep titles short and scannable.\n-  - Avoid over-styling; let whitespace and hierarchy do most of the work.\n-\n-  ### 4.3 Iconography & Illustration\n-\n-  - Icons should be simple and consistent, ideally line-based or minimal solid icons.\n-  - Avoid cartoon mascots and over-cute elements.\n-  - If using illustrations, prefer abstract representations of flows, nodes, or grids rather than generic “businesspeople with laptops.”\n-\n-  ---\n-\n-  ## 5. Product UX Principles\n-\n-  1. **One Shell, Many Apps**  \n-     - The sidebar and header are stable anchors across CRM, ERP, Billing, and Bots.\n-     - Switching between modules should feel like changing panels, not switching websites.\n-\n-  2. **Keep Context With the User**  \n-     - From any client record, you should be able to see related deals, invoices, tasks, and automations without opening five tabs.\n-\n-  3. **Explain Automations**  \n-     - Every automated action (sending an invoice, updating a status, posting a message) should be visible and traceable.\n-     - Provide an “automation log” or similar view.\n-\n-  4. **Multi-Tenant Safety by Design**  \n-     - Make organization boundaries obvious.\n-     - Never make it easy to confuse data between orgs or clients.\n-\n-  5. **Design for Everyday Use, Not Demos**  \n-     - Optimize for the daily workflows of small agencies and businesses:\n-       - Lead → quote → project → invoice → payment.\n-     - Fancy dashboards are secondary to clean, efficient flows.\n-\n-  ---\n-\n-  ## 6. Naming System (Modules & Sub-Brands)\n-\n-  Assuming **Unison** as master brand:\n-\n-  - **Platform:** Unison OS\n-  - **Modules:**\n-    - **Unison CRM** – Leads, pipelines, activities, deals.\n-    - **Unison ERP** – Invoices, ledgers, inventory, suppliers.\n-    - **Unison Billing** – Subscriptions, one-off invoices, payment status.\n-    - **Unison Bots** – AI assistants, chatbots, workflow automations.\n-    - **Unison Core** – Auth, organizations, users, plans, multi-tenancy.\n-\n-  Guidelines:\n-\n-  - Use full module names in documentation and marketing.\n-  - Inside the app, you can shorten to **CRM**, **ERP**, **Billing**, **Bots**, **Core** once users are oriented.\n-\n-  ---\n-\n-  ## 7. Example Taglines & Messaging\n-\n-  Short taglines:\n-\n-  - “Bring your business tools into unison.”\n-  - “One operating system for your whole business.”\n-  - “From lead to invoice, in one flow.”\n-\n-  Homepage hero example:\n-\n-  > **Run your business in unison.**  \n-  > Unison OS connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots in a single workspace, so your team always works from the same source of truth.\n-\n-  Subheading example:\n-\n-  > No more switching apps or copying data by hand.  \n-  > See every client, project, and invoice in one place, with automations you can trust and understand.\n-\n-  ---\n-\n-  ## 8. Out of Scope (What Unison Is Not)\n-\n-  - Not a generic task or note-taking app.\n-  - Not a “growth hack” dashboard.\n-  - Not just an integration layer that tapes together other tools.\n-  - Not limited to one country or language; English-first, translation-ready.\n-\n-  Unison is built as **infrastructure for small businesses and agencies**: multi-tenant, schema-based, event-driven.  \n-  The brand should feel as solid and coherent as the architecture.\n+generated: \"{{generated}}\"\n+project: \"Nu\"\n+project_type: \"{{project_type}}\"\n+selected_track: \"{{selected_track}}\"\n+field_type: \"{{field_type}}\"\n+workflow_path: \"{{workflow_path_file}}\"\n+workflow_status: \"{{workflow_items}}\"\n+project_description: |-\n+  This project is about creating the ultimate (multilingual) all-in-one SaaS PWA app that will replace/enhance/optimize S&MBs, bringing them to the spearhead of technological development and AI. In other words:\n+\n+  # Unio – Brand Guidelines (v0.2, First Principles Draft)\n+\n+  > Working name: **Unio**  \n+  > These guidelines describe the brand foundations for the Business OS project.  \n+  > If the project is renamed later, treat \"Unio\" as a placeholder and update accordingly.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 1. Brand Core\n+\n+  ### 1.1 Problem From First Principles\n+\n+  - Small businesses and agencies run on **workflows**, not tools: lead → quote → project → invoice → payment → reporting.\n+  - Today those workflows are split across **unrelated SaaS tools**, ad-hoc spreadsheets, and messaging apps (often WhatsApp).\n+  - The real pain is not “missing features” but:\n+    - **Fragmented state** (no single source of truth),\n+    - **Manual glue work** (copy/paste, exports, screenshots),\n+    - **Invisible automations** (things happen but nobody knows how or why).\n+  - Owners care about **control and clarity** more than “AI magic.”\n+  - Any solution that doesn’t respect **multi-tenant reality, accounting correctness, and permissions** will be rejected in practice.\n+\n+  ### 1.2 First-Principles Solution\n+\n+  From those fundamentals:\n+\n+  - Unio is **not** “just another CRM or ERP.”\n+  - Unio is:\n+    - A **unified shell**: one calm workspace instead of ten tabs.\n+    - A **consistent data model**: clients, projects, invoices, and conversations all line up.\n+    - An **event-driven backbone**: everything important (a deal closing, an invoice being paid, a bot sending a message) is an explicit event.\n+    - A **visible automation layer**: workflows are inspectable, explainable, and correctable.\n+    - An **AI operations brain**: the system can propose and trigger next actions across flows, based on the live state of the business.\n+\n+  > **Unio is the operating system and AI brain for small businesses and agencies: one workspace, one data model, and one automation layer for the flows that actually run the business.**\n+\n+  ### 1.3 Refined One-Liner\n+\n+  > **Run your whole business with one calm OS + AI brain – Unio connects CRM, ERP, billing, and automations so your small or medium business can run day-to-day operations from a single workspace.**\n+\n+  ### 1.4 Refined Elevator Pitch\n+\n+  Most small businesses and agencies don’t suffer from a lack of tools; they suffer from tools that don’t agree with each other.\n+\n+  Leads live in one app, invoices in another, tasks in a third, and critical decisions happen in WhatsApp threads and owner memory.\n+\n+  Unio starts from a different premise:\n+\n+  - The business has a **small number of critical flows** that must always work: from first contact to paid invoice (and beyond).\n+  - Those flows deserve **one operating system and one AI brain**, not a chain of brittle integrations.\n+\n+  With Unio:\n+\n+  - The team works in a **single shell** that feels like a native desktop app, not a pile of tabs.\n+  - CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots are **modules** on a shared data model and event system.\n+  - Every automation—whether it’s creating an invoice, updating a status, or sending a reminder—is **logged and explainable**.\n+  - The AI layer acts as an **operations brain**: suggesting and orchestrating next actions so day-to-day work keeps flowing with less manual oversight.\n+\n+  Result: operators get calm, predictable control; owners get a trustworthy picture of the business; AI becomes infrastructure for daily operations, not a gimmick.\n+\n+  ### 1.5 Brand Promise\n+\n+  > **“Bring your business tools into unio, and run every critical flow from one place.”**\n+\n+  ### 1.6 Brand Pillars (Tightened)\n+\n+  1. **Unity of Workflows** – From lead to invoice, flows live in one system, on one schema.\n+  2. **Calm Control** – No drama: clear states, predictable automations, stable UI.\n+  3. **Visible Automation** – Every automated action is logged, explainable, and overridable.\n+  4. **Operational Reality** – Built for multi-tenant ledgers, permissions, and real-world constraints from day one.\n+  5. **Localization-Ready** – Copy, UX, and data model are designed to work across languages and markets.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 2. Brand Personality\n+\n+  If Unio were a person, it would be:\n+\n+  - **Analytical but human** – understands workflows and numbers, but speaks plainly.\n+  - **Calm and composed** – no hype, no panic, just steady progress.\n+  - **Quietly powerful** – does heavy lifting behind the scenes, without showing off.\n+  - **Trustworthy and transparent** – automation is explainable, not magic.\n+\n+  Avoid personalities like:\n+\n+  - The loud “growth hacker” promising to 10x everything overnight.\n+  - The jargon-heavy consultant who hides simple ideas behind complex language.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 3.

I want one place where I can see and steer.”\n\n**Does**\n\n- Checks multiple dashboards and chats to piece together reality.\n- Manually nudges people to follow up or send invoices.\n- Tries new tools, abandons them when they add complexity.\n\n**Pains**\n\n- No single source of truth.\n- Fear of missing something critical (payments, client issues).\n- High dependency on specific people’s memory and personal systems.\n\n**Gains (with Unio)**\n\n- One calm workspace showing the current state of the business.\n- An AI operations brain that surfaces what needs attention today.\n- Confidence that critical flows (lead → invoice → payment) keep moving even when they’re offline.\n\n---\n\n#### Persona 2 – Operations / General Manager (“Integrator”)\n\n**Thinks**\n\n- “If the workflow is clear, the team can execute.”\n- “Right now I’m the human router between tools and people.”\n- “I need systems that scale beyond my personal spreadsheets.”\n\n**Feels**\n\n- Responsible for “how the business actually runs.”\n- Frustrated by brittle integrations and hidden automations.\n- Motivated by clean processes and visible ownership.\n\n**Sees**\n\n- Teams creating their own side-systems (Notion, sheets, private boards).\n- Automation rules scattered across tools (Zapier, Make, native automations).\n- Repeated bottlenecks at the same stages of the flow.\n\n**Says**\n\n- “Where does this data actually come from?”\n- “Who owns this step in the process?”\n- “If we change this, what else breaks?”\n\n**Does**\n\n- Builds and maintains integrations, templates, SOPs.\n- Reconciles data between systems at end of week/month.\n- Translates leadership priorities into tasks across tools.\n\n**Pains**\n\n- Being the single point of failure for process knowledge.\n- Debugging invisible automations when something silently fails.\n- Wasting time reconciling data instead of improving flows.\n\n**Gains (with Unio)**\n\n- One OS where flows are modeled explicitly and can be improved centrally.\n- An automation log that shows what the AI + workflows did, and why.\n- Ability to design, monitor, and adjust end-to-end flows without duct tape.\n\n---\n\n#### Persona 3 – Client-Facing Lead (Account / Project Lead)\n\n**Thinks**\n\n- “My job is to keep clients happy and work moving.”\n- “I spend too much time chasing information.”\n- “I don’t care which tool, I care about not dropping the ball.”\n\n**Feels**\n\n- Stressed by context switching and fragmented information.\n- Embarrassed when the team misses follow-ups or invoices.\n- Relieved when there’s a clear, reliable system.\n\n**Sees**\n\n- Client info scattered: email in one place, invoices in another, tasks in a third.\n- Different stakeholders giving different answers about status.\n- Last-minute scrambles before client meetings.\n\n**Says**\n\n- “Where’s the latest on this client?”\n- “Did we actually send that invoice?”\n- “Can someone please unify this view?”\n\n**Does**\n\n- Rebuilds client timelines from email, chat, and tools.\n- Creates personal checklists to compensate for system gaps.\n- Pings ops/finance for status updates.\n\n**Pains**\n\n- Losing time to hunting and re-stating context.\n- Feeling responsible for errors caused by the system, not them.\n- Lack of trust in dashboards vs “asking around.”\n\n**Gains (with Unio)**\n\n- One client view: conversations, deals, projects, invoices, automations.\n- An AI assistant that surfaces “what’s next” per client and per day.\n- Confidence that nothing important falls through the cracks.\n```\n\nThis doesn’t change your existing Brand Core statements; it **deepens** them by making the “OS + AI brain for day-to-day operations” concrete through real people and their pains/gains.\n\nDo you want to **apply this new 1.7 Key Personas section** to the stored Brand Guidelines?\n\n- Reply **`y`** to add 1.7 exactly as above.  \n- Reply **`n`** to discard it.  \n- Or give edits (e.g., “keep personas 1 and 2 only” / “simplify bullets”)."}}

In other words:\n\n  # Unio – Brand Guidelines (v0.2, First Principles Draft)\n\n  > Working name: **Unio**  \n  > These guidelines describe the brand foundations for the Business OS project.  \n  > If the project is renamed later, treat \"Unio\" as a placeholder and update accordingly.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 1. Brand Core\n\n  ### 1.1 Problem From First Principles\n\n  - Small businesses and agencies run on **workflows**, not tools: lead → quote → project → invoice → payment → reporting.\n  - Today those workflows are split across **unrelated SaaS tools**, ad-hoc spreadsheets, and messaging apps (often WhatsApp).\n  - The real pain is not “missing features” but:\n    - **Fragmented state** (no single source of truth),\n    - **Manual glue work** (copy/paste, exports, screenshots),\n    - **Invisible automations** (things happen but nobody knows how or why).\n  - Owners care about **control and clarity** more than “AI magic.”\n  - Any solution that doesn’t respect **multi-tenant reality, accounting correctness, and permissions** will be rejected in practice.\n\n  ### 1.2 First-Principles Solution\n\n  From those fundamentals:\n\n  - Unio is **not** “just another CRM or ERP.”\n  - Unio is:\n    - A **unified shell**: one calm workspace instead of ten tabs.\n    - A **consistent data model**: clients, projects, invoices, and conversations all line up.\n    - An **event-driven backbone**: everything important (a deal closing, an invoice being paid, a bot sending a message) is an explicit event.\n    - A **visible automation layer**: workflows are inspectable, explainable, and correctable.\n    - An **AI operations brain**: the system can propose and trigger next actions across flows, based on the live state of the business.\n\n  > **Unio is the operating system and AI brain for small businesses and agencies: one workspace, one data model, and one automation layer for the flows that actually run the business.**\n\n  ### 1.3 Refined One-Liner\n\n  > **Run your whole business with one calm OS + AI brain – Unio connects CRM, ERP, billing, and automations so your small or medium business can run day-to-day operations from a single workspace.**\n\n  ### 1.4 Refined Elevator Pitch\n\n  Most small businesses and agencies don’t suffer from a lack of tools; they suffer from tools that don’t agree with each other.\n\n  Leads live in one app, invoices in another, tasks in a third, and critical decisions happen in WhatsApp threads and owner memory.\n\n  Unio starts from a different premise:\n\n  - The business has a **small number of critical flows** that must always work: from first contact to paid invoice (and beyond).\n  - Those flows deserve **one operating system and one AI brain**, not a chain of brittle integrations.\n\n  With Unio:\n\n  - The team works in a **single shell** that feels like a native desktop app, not a pile of tabs.\n  - CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots are **modules** on a shared data model and event system.\n  - Every automation—whether it’s creating an invoice, updating a status, or sending a reminder—is **logged and explainable**.\n  - The AI layer acts as an **operations brain**: suggesting and orchestrating next actions so day-to-day work keeps flowing with less manual oversight.\n\n  Result: operators get calm, predictable control; owners get a trustworthy picture of the business; AI becomes infrastructure for daily operations, not a gimmick.\n\n  ### 1.5 Brand Promise\n\n  > **“Bring your business tools into unio, and run every critical flow from one place.”**\n\n  ### 1.6 Brand Pillars (Tightened)\n\n  1. **Unity of Workflows** – From lead to invoice, flows live in one system, on one schema.\n  2. **Calm Control** – No drama: clear states, predictable automations, stable UI.\n  3. **Visible Automation** – Every automated action is logged, explainable, and overridab…728 chars truncated…on-heavy consultant who hides simple ideas behind complex language.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 3. Voice & Tone\n\n  ### 3.1 Principles\n\n  1. **Plain, clear English**  \n     - Write for busy operators and owners.\n     - Short sentences. Concrete nouns. Few buzzwords.\n\n  2. **Confident, not arrogant**  \n     - We know what we’re doing, but we don’t promise miracles.\n     - Say: “Unio reduces errors and copy-paste work,” not “eliminates all problems forever.”\n\n  3. **Calm and reassuring**  \n     - Focus on stability, consistency, and clarity.\n     - Avoid fear tactics and fake urgency.\n\n  4. **Localization-friendly**  \n     - Use language that will translate cleanly later.\n     - Avoid idioms and jokes that only make sense in one culture.\n\n  ### 3.2 Writing Examples\n\n  **Good (homepage hero):**\n\n  > Run your business from one workspace.  \n  > Unio connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots so your team always works in sync.\n\n  **Bad (too hype):**\n\n  > Smash chaos with our AI super-suite and 10x your growth in a week!\n\n  **Good (feature explanation):**\n\n  > When a deal is marked as won, Unio can create the project, schedule tasks, and issue the invoice.  \n  > You can see every step in the automation log.\n\n  **Bad (too vague / magical):**\n\n  > Our AI takes care of everything behind the scenes. Just sit back and relax.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 4. Visual Identity (v0.1)\n\n  These are starting points for design; they will evolve with real UI work.\n\n  ### 4.1 Color Direction\n\n  Concept: **Orchestrated calm.**\n\n  - **Base:** Deep neutral (charcoal / ink) for backgrounds or major chrome.\n  - **Primary accent:** A modern blue or teal that suggests clarity and flow.\n  - **Secondary accents:** Soft gradients or subtle secondary colors for CRM vs ERP vs Bots.\n\n  Usage:\n\n  - Use color to signal **state** (success, warning, error) and **hierarchy**, not decoration.\n  - Each core module can lean on a slightly different accent shade while keeping the overall look cohesive.\n\n  ### 4.2 Typography\n\n  Goals:\n\n  - Highly legible for tables, metrics, and forms.\n  - Works across many locales and screen sizes.\n\n  Suggestions:\n\n  - **Headings:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar).\n  - **Body text:** Same family, regular weight, 14–16px for readability.\n\n  Rules:\n\n  - Keep titles short and scannable.\n  - Avoid over-styling; let whitespace and hierarchy do most of the work.\n\n  ### 4.3 Iconography & Illustration\n\n  - Icons should be simple and consistent, ideally line-based or minimal solid icons.\n  - Avoid cartoon mascots and over-cute elements.\n  - If using illustrations, prefer abstract representations of flows, nodes, or grids rather than generic “businesspeople with laptops.”\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 5. Product UX Principles\n\n  1. **One Shell, Many Apps**  \n     - The sidebar and header are stable anchors across CRM, ERP, Billing, and Bots.\n     - Switching between modules should feel like changing panels, not switching websites.\n\n  2. **Keep Context With the User**  \n     - From any client record, you should be able to see related deals, invoices, tasks, and automations without opening five tabs.\n\n  3. **Explain Automations**  \n     - Every automated action (sending an invoice, updating a status, posting a message) should be visible and traceable.\n     - Provide an “automation log” or similar view.\n\n  4. **Multi-Tenant Safety by Design**  \n     - Make organization boundaries obvious.\n     - Never make it easy to confuse data between orgs or clients.\n\n  5. **Design for Everyday Use, Not Demos**  \n     - Optimize for the daily workflows of small agencies and businesses:\n       - Lead → quote → project → invoice → payment.\n     - Fancy dashboards are secondary to clean, efficient flows.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 6. Naming System (Modules & Sub-Brands)\n\n  Assuming **Unio** as master brand:\n\n  - **Platform:** Unio OS\n  - **Modules:**\n    - **Unio CRM** – Leads, pipelines, activities, deals.\n    - **Unio ERP** – Invoices, ledgers, inventory, suppliers.\n    - **Unio Billing** – Subscriptions, one-off invoices, payment status.\n    - **Unio Bots** – AI assistants, chatbots, workflow automations.\n    - **Unio Core** – Auth, organizations, users, plans, multi-tenancy.\n\n  Guidelines:\n\n  - Use full module names in documentation and marketing.\n  - Inside the app, you can shorten to **CRM**, **ERP**, **Billing**, **Bots**, **Core** once users are oriented.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 7. Example Taglines & Messaging\n\n  Short taglines:\n\n  - “Bring your business tools into unio.”\n  - “One operating system for your whole business.”\n  - “From lead to invoice, in one flow.”\n\n  Homepage hero example:\n\n  > **Run your business in unio.**  \n  > Unio OS connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots in a single workspace, so your team always works from the same source of truth.\n\n  Subheading example:\n\n  > No more switching apps or copying data by hand.  \n  > See every client, project, and invoice in one place, with automations you can trust and understand.\n"}}

Out of Scope (What Unio Is Not)\n\n  - Not a generic task or note-taking app.\n  - Not a “growth hack” dashboard.\n  - Not just an integration layer that tapes together other tools.\n  - Not limited to one country or language; English-first, translation-ready.\n\n  Unio is built as **infrastructure for small businesses and agencies**: multi-tenant, schema-based, event-driven.  \n  The brand should feel as solid and coherent as the architecture.\n"}}

In other words:\n\n  # Unio – Brand Guidelines (v0.2, First Principles Draft)\n\n  > Working name: **Unio**  \n  > These guidelines describe the brand foundations for the Business OS project.  \n  > If the project is renamed later, treat \"Unio\" as a placeholder and update accordingly.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 1. Brand Core\n\n  ### 1.1 Problem From First Principles\n\n  - Small businesses and agencies run on **workflows**, not tools: lead → quote → project → invoice → payment → reporting.\n  - Today those workflows are split across **unrelated SaaS tools**, ad-hoc spreadsheets, and messaging apps (often WhatsApp).\n  - The real pain is not “missing features” but:\n    - **Fragmented state** (no single source of truth),\n    - **Manual glue work** (copy/paste, exports, screenshots),\n    - **Invisible automations** (things happen but nobody knows how or why).\n  - Owners care about **control and clarity** more than “AI magic.”\n  - Any solution that doesn’t respect **multi-tenant reality, accounting correctness, and permissions** will be rejected in practice.\n\n  ### 1.2 First-Principles Solution\n\n  From those fundamentals:\n\n  - Unio is **not** “just another CRM or ERP.”\n  - Unio is:\n    - A **unified shell**: one calm workspace instead of ten tabs.\n    - A **consistent data model**: clients, projects, invoices, and conversations all line up.\n    - An **event-driven backbone**: everything important (a deal closing, an invoice being paid, a bot sending a message) is an explicit event.\n    - A **visible automation layer**: workflows are inspectable, explainable, and correctable.\n    - An **AI operations brain**: the system can propose and trigger next actions across flows, based on the live state of the business.\n\n  > **Unio is the operating system and AI brain for small businesses and agencies: one workspace, one data model, and one automation layer for the flows that actually run the business.**\n\n  ### 1.3 Refined One-Liner\n\n  > **Run your whole business with one calm OS + AI brain – Unio connects CRM, ERP, billing, and automations so your small or medium business can run day-to-day operations from a single workspace.**\n\n  ### 1.4 Refined Elevator Pitch\n\n  Most small businesses and agencies don’t suffer from a lack of tools; they suffer from tools that don’t agree with each other.\n\n  Leads live in one app, invoices in another, tasks in a third, and critical decisions happen in WhatsApp threads and owner memory.\n\n  Unio starts from a different premise:\n\n  - The business has a **small number of critical flows** that must always work: from first contact to paid invoice (and beyond).\n  - Those flows deserve **one operating system and one AI brain**, not a chain of brittle integrations.\n\n  With Unio:\n\n  - The team works in a **single shell** that feels like a native desktop app, not a pile of tabs.\n  - CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots are **modules** on a shared data model and event system.\n  - Every automation—whether it’s creating an invoice, updating a status, or sending a reminder—is **logged and explainable**.\n  - The AI layer acts as an **operations brain**: suggesting and orchestrating next actions so day-to-day work keeps flowing with less manual oversight.\n\n  Result: operators get calm, predictable control; owners get a trustworthy picture of the business; AI becomes infrastructure for daily operations, not a gimmick.\n\n  ### 1.5 Brand Promise\n\n  > **“Bring your business tools into unio, and run every critical flow from one place.”**\n\n  ### 1.6 Brand Pillars (Tightened)\n\n  1. **Unity of Workflows** – From lead to invoice, flows live in one system, on one schema.\n  2. **Calm Control** – No drama: clear states, predictable automations, stable UI.\n  3. **Visible Automation** – Every automated action is logged, explainable, and overridable.\n  4. **Operational Reality** – Built for multi-tenant ledgers, permissions, and real-world constraints from day one.\n  5. **Localization-Ready** – Copy, UX, and data model are designed to work across languages and markets.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 2. Brand Personality\n\n  If Unio were a person, it would be:\n\n  - **Analytical but human** – understands workflows and numbers, but speaks plainly.\n  - **Calm and composed** – no hype, no panic, just steady progress.\n  - **Quietly powerful** – does heavy lifting behind the scenes, without showing off.\n  - **Trustworthy and transparent** – automation is explainable, not magic.\n\n  Avoid personalities like:\n\n  - The loud “growth hacker” promising to 10x everything overnight.\n  - The jargon-heavy consultant who hides simple ideas behind complex language.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 3. Voice & Tone\n\n  ### 3.1 Principles\n\n  1. **Plain, clear English**  \n     - Write for busy operators and owners.\n     - Short sentences. Concrete nouns. Few buzzwords.\n\n  2. **Confident, not arrogant**  \n     - We know what we’re doing, but we don’t promise miracles.\n     - Say: “Unio reduces errors and copy-paste work,” not “eliminates all problems forever.”\n\n  3. **Calm and reassuring**  \n     - Focus on stability, consistency, and clarity.\n     - Avoid fear tactics and fake urgency.\n\n  4. **Localization-friendly**  \n     - Use language that will translate cleanly later.\n     - Avoid idioms and jokes that only make sense in one culture.\n\n  ### 3.2 Writing Examples\n\n  **Good (homepage hero):**\n\n  > Run your business from one workspace.  \n  > Unio connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots so your team always works in sync.\n\n  **Bad (too hype):**\n\n  > Smash chaos with our AI super-suite and 10x your growth in a week!\n\n  **Good (feature explanation):**\n\n  > When a deal is marked as won, Unio can create the project, schedule tasks, and issue the invoice.  \n  > You can see every step in the automation log.\n\n  **Bad (too vague / magical):**\n\n  > Our AI takes care of everything behind the scenes. Just sit back and relax.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 4. Visual Identity (v0.1)\n\n  These are starting points for design; they will evolve with real UI work.\n\n  ### 4.1 Color Direction\n\n  Concept: **Orchestrated calm.**\n\n  - **Base:** Deep neutral (charcoal / ink) for backgrounds or major chrome.\n  - **Primary accent:** A modern blue or teal that suggests clarity and flow.\n  - **Secondary accents:** Soft gradients or subtle secondary colors for CRM vs ERP vs Bots.\n\n  Usage:\n\n  - Use color to signal **state** (success, warning, error) and **hierarchy**, not decoration.\n  - Each core module can lean on a slightly different accent shade while keeping the overall look cohesive.\n\n  ### 4.2 Typography\n\n  Goals:\n\n  - Highly legible for tables, metrics, and forms.\n  - Works across many locales and screen sizes.\n\n  Suggestions:\n\n  - **Headings:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar).\n  - **Body text:** Same family, regular weight, 14–16px for readability.\n\n  Rules:\n\n  - Keep titles short and scannable.\n  - Avoid over-styling; let whitespace and hierarchy do most of the work.\n\n  ### 4.3 Iconography & Illustration\n\n  - Icons should be simple and consistent, ideally line-based or minimal solid icons.\n  - Avoid cartoon mascots and over-cute elements.\n  - If using illustrations, prefer abstract representations of flows, nodes, or grids rather than generic “businesspeople with laptops.”\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 5. Product UX Principles\n\n  1. **One Shell, Many Apps**  \n     - The sidebar and header are stable anchors across CRM, ERP, Billing, and Bots.\n     - Switching between modules should feel like changing panels, not switching websites.\n\n  2. **Keep Context With the User**  \n     - From any client record, you should be able to see related deals, invoices, tasks, and automations without opening five tabs.\n\n  3. **Explain Automations**  \n     - Every automated action (sending an invoice, updating a status, posting a message) should be visible and traceable.\n     - Provide an “automation log” or similar view.\n\n  4. **Multi-Tenant Safety by Design**  \n     - Make organization boundaries obvious.\n     - Never make it easy to confuse data between orgs or clients.\n\n  5. **Design for Everyday Use, Not Demos**  \n     - Optimize for the daily workflows of small agencies and businesses:\n       - Lead → quote → project → invoice → payment.\n"}}

Naming System (Modules & Sub-Brands)\n\n  Assuming **Unio** as master brand:\n\n  - **Platform:** Unio OS\n  - **Modules:**\n    - **Unio CRM** – Leads, pipelines, activities, deals.\n    - **Unio ERP** – Invoices, ledgers, inventory, suppliers.\n    - **Unio Billing** – Subscriptions, one-off invoices, payment status.\n    - **Unio Bots** – AI assistants, chatbots, workflow automations.\n    - **Unio Core** – Auth, organizations, users, plans, multi-tenancy.\n\n  Guidelines:\n\n  - Use full module names in documentation and marketing.\n  - Inside the app, you can shorten to **CRM**, **ERP**, **Billing**, **Bots**, **Core** once users are oriented.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 7. Example Taglines & Messaging\n\n  Short taglines:\n\n  - “Bring your business tools into unio.”\n  - “One operating system for your whole business.”\n  - “From lead to invoice, in one flow.”\n\n  Homepage hero example:\n\n  > **Run your business in unio.**  \n  > Unio OS connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots in a single workspace, so your team always works from the same source of truth.\n\n  Subheading example:\n\n  > No more switching apps or copying data by hand.  \n  > See every client, project, and invoice in one place, with automations you can trust and understand.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 8. Out of Scope (What Unio Is Not)\n\n  - Not a generic task or note-taking app.\n  - Not a “growth hack” dashboard.\n  - Not just an integration layer that tapes together other tools.\n  - Not limited to one country or language; English-first, translation-ready.\n\n  Unio is built as **infrastructure for small businesses and agencies**: multi-tenant, schema-based, event-driven.  \n  The brand should feel as solid and coherent as the architecture.\n"}}

I want one place where I can see and steer.”\n+\n+  **Does**\n+\n+  - Checks multiple dashboards and chats to piece together reality.\n+  - Manually nudges people to follow up or send invoices.\n+  - Tries new tools, abandons them when they add complexity.\n+\n+  **Pains**\n+\n+  - No single source of truth.\n+  - Fear of missing something critical (payments, client issues).\n+  - High dependency on specific people’s memory and personal systems.\n+\n+  **Gains (with Xentri)**\n+\n+  - One calm workspace that shows the real state of the business at a glance.\n+  - Xentri’s AI operations brain keeps the core flows (lead → quote → project → invoice → payment) moving automatically, and surfaces what needs their attention today.\n+  - Confidence that things keep moving even when they are offline or travelling.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  #### Persona 2 – Operations / General Manager (“Integrator”)\n+\n+  **Thinks**\n+\n+  - “If the workflow is clear, the team can execute.”\n+  - “Right now I’m the human router between tools and people.”\n+  - “I need systems that scale beyond my personal spreadsheets.”\n+\n+  **Feels**\n+\n+  - Responsible for “how the business actually runs.”\n+  - Frustrated by brittle integrations and hidden automations.\n+  - Motivated by clean processes and visible ownership.\n+\n+  **Sees**\n+\n+  - Teams creating their own side-systems (Notion, sheets, private boards).\n+  - Automation rules scattered across tools (Zapier, Make, native automations).\n+  - Repeated bottlenecks at the same stages of the flow.\n+\n+  **Says**\n+\n+  - “Where does this data actually come from?”\n+  - “Who owns this step in the process?”\n+  - “If we change this, what else breaks?”\n+\n+  **Does**\n+\n+  - Builds and maintains integrations, templates, SOPs.\n+  - Reconciles data between systems at end of week/month.\n+  - Translates leadership priorities into tasks across tools.\n+\n+  **Pains**\n+\n+  - Being the single point of failure for process knowledge.\n+  - Debugging invisible automations when something silently fails.\n+  - Wasting time reconciling data instead of improving flows.\n+\n+  **Gains (with Xentri)**\n+\n+  - One OS where end-to-end flows are modeled explicitly and can be improved centrally instead of in ten tools.\n+  - An automation log that shows what Xentri (AI + workflows) did, when, and why, so debugging is transparent.\n+  - Xentri takes over the routine routing, updates and reconciliations, so ops can focus on designing and improving processes instead of being the human glue.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  #### Persona 3 – Client-Facing Lead (Account / Project Lead)\n+\n+  **Thinks**\n+\n+  - “My job is to keep clients happy and work moving.”\n+  - “I spend too much time chasing information.”\n+  - “I don’t care which tool, I care about not dropping the ball.”\n+\n+  **Feels**\n+\n+  - Stressed by context switching and fragmented information.\n+  - Embarrassed when the team misses follow-ups or invoices.\n+  - Relieved when there’s a clear, reliable system.\n+\n+  **Sees**\n+\n+  - Client info scattered: email in one place, invoices in another, tasks in a third.\n+  - Different stakeholders giving different answers about status.\n+  - Last-minute scrambles before client meetings.\n+\n+  **Says**\n+\n+  - “Where’s the latest on this client?”\n+  - “Did we actually send that invoice?”\n+  - “Can someone please unify this view?”\n+\n+  **Does**\n+\n+  - Rebuilds client timelines from email, chat, and tools.\n+  - Creates personal checklists to compensate for system gaps.\n+  - Pings ops/finance for status updates.\n+\n+  **Pains**\n+\n+  - Losing time to hunting and re-stating context.\n+  - Feeling responsible for errors caused by the system, not them.\n+  - Lack of trust in dashboards vs “asking around.”\n+\n+  **Gains (with Xentri)**\n+\n+  - One client view with conversations, deals, projects, invoices and automations in a single place.\n+  - An AI assistant in Xentri that tells them “what’s next” for each client and each day, so follow-ups and invoicing don’t depend on their memory.\n+  - Confidence that important steps won’t fall through the cracks, even when they’re context switching.\n+\n+  ---\n+\n+  ## 2.
