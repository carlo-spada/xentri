## Architecture Document Quality

### Structural Elements

- [ ] **Executive Summary / Overview** articulating architectural vision
- [ ] **High-Level Architecture** with system/component diagram reference
- [ ] **Technology Stack** with justified choices
- [ ] **Data Architecture** or data model approach
- [ ] **Integration Patterns** for inter-component communication
- [ ] **ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records) for significant decisions

### PRD Alignment

- [ ] Each functional requirement has architectural support
- [ ] Interface contracts have implementation patterns
- [ ] NFRs (performance, security, scalability) addressed architecturally
- [ ] Traceability to PRD requirements present

### ADR Coverage

- [ ] Major technology choices have ADRs
- [ ] Significant pattern decisions documented
- [ ] Trade-offs explicitly stated
- [ ] ADR status maintained (proposed/accepted/deprecated)

### Implementation Readiness

- [ ] All components identified for implementation
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Test strategy implied
- [ ] Deployment considerations noted
