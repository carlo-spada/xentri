# Epic Breakdown Validation Checklist

## 1. Traceability (CRITICAL)

- [ ] **Traceability Matrix**: Is the table present?
- [ ] **FR Coverage**: Every FR covered by at least one story?
- [ ] **Story References**: Every story links to an FR?
- [ ] **PR/IC Compliance**: Stories mention relevant PRs/ICs?
- [ ] **No Orphans**: No FRs left behind, no stories without purpose?

## 2. Story Quality

- [ ] **User Story Format**: "As a... I want... So that..."
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Numbered, testable list?
- [ ] **Vertical Slices**: Does it deliver end-to-end value?
- [ ] **Sizing**: Is it small enough for a sprint?

## 3. Sequencing

- [ ] **Foundation First**: Logical build order?
- [ ] **No Forward Dependencies**: Do we have what we need?
- [ ] **Cross-Team Dependencies**: Are blockers identified?
