It solves \"tab fatigue\" by providing a unified shell while maintaining the scalability of microservices.\n\n**Status:** Early-stage, not production-ready (API and CRM MVP under active development). This repository currently contains documentation and planning artifacts; the code scaffolding described below will land in upcoming commits.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\n**Prerequisites:** Docker, Node.js 20+\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/carlo-spada/xentri.git\ncd xentri\n\n# 2. Configure Environment\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# 3.

It is the \"Constitution\" for how we build, enabling us to add new modules (CMS, Marketing, HR) indefinitely without creating a monolith.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nThis platform is designed to be an **\"Operating System for Business,\"** automating disparate functions (CRM, ERP, AI Bots, Legal) into a single, cohesive experience.\n\nUnlike traditional SaaS which suffers from \"tab fatigue\" (switching between different tools), this architecture uses a **Unified App Shell** to provide a seamless, native-app feel while maintaining strict technical isolation between services for scalability and team autonomy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Blueprint: \"Decoupled Unity\"\n\nWe strictly separate the **User Experience** from the **Business Logic**.\n\n| Layer | Metaphor | Role |\n|-------|----------|------|\n| **The Shell (Astro)** | The \"Body\" | A lightweight, server-rendered container that handles the frame, authentication, and routing. It creates the illusion of a Single Page Application (SPA). |\n| **The Organs (React Micro-Apps)** | The \"Capabilities\" | Interactive tools (CRM, ERP) bundled as libraries and lazy-loaded into the Shell. |\n| **The Engine (Docker Microservices)** | The \"Muscle\" | Isolated backend containers that handle heavy processing, Python/Go logic, and database transactions. |\n| **The Nervous System (Events)** | The \"Signals\" | An event-driven layer that prevents services from talking directly to each other, ensuring the system remains modular. |\n\n### Visual Data Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    User[User Browser] -->|HTTPS| CDN[Edge Network / Vercel]\n    CDN -->|Serves| Shell[Astro App Shell]\n\n    subgraph \"Frontend (Browser)\"\n        Shell -->|Loads| Sidebar[Nano Store UI State]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| CRM[React CRM App]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| ERP[React ERP App]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Backend (Docker Swarm / K8s)\"\n        CRM -->|API JSON| APIG[API Gateway]\n        ERP -->|API JSON| APIG\n\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/crm| Svc1[CRM Service Node]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/erp| Svc2[ERP Service Go/Python]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/bot| Svc3[AI Bot Service Python]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"The Nervous System (Async)\"\n        Svc3 -->|Event: ChatFinished| Redis[Redis Streams]\n        Redis -->|Transport| N8N[n8n Workflow Engine]\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc1\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc2\n    end\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Repository Structure (Turborepo)\n\nWe use a **Monorepo** to share types and UI standards while enforcing strict isolation between business domains.\n\n```\n/business-os-monorepo\n├── /apps\n│   ├── /shell                # ASTRO.

The \"Nervous System\" (Event Architecture)\n\nTo ensure we can continuously plug in new modules (e.g., adding a \"Marketing Module\" next year without rewriting the CRM), we use a **two-layer event system**.\n\n### A. The Transport Layer: Redis Streams\n\n| Attribute | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Role** | High-volume, internal system synchronization. The \"Spinal Cord.\" |\n| **Use Case** | Data Integrity |\n| **Example** | User updates their avatar in the Shell → Redis Event → CRM Service updates its cache → ERP Service updates its cache. |\n| **Why** | It is immutable, blazing fast, and ensures services stay decoupled. |\n\n### B. The Logic Layer: n8n (Self-Hosted)\n\n| Attribute | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Role** | Business Logic Orchestration & Third-Party Integrations. The \"Brain.\" |\n| **Use Case** | Complex, malleable workflows. |\n| **Example** | \"When `lead_status` becomes `won`, generate a PDF contract, sign via DocuSign, and Slack the Sales Manager.\" |\n\n**Why n8n?**\n\n- **Visibility:** Analysts can visualize the business logic flow.\n- **Client Empowerment:** We can expose a restricted view to clients, allowing them to tweak their own automations (e.g., \"Change the alert email address\") without engineering involvement.\n\n### Event Flow Example\n\n```\n1. Bot Service finishes a conversation.\n2. Emits event: conversation.completed\n3. n8n catches event → Triggers \"Sentiment Analysis\" → Triggers \"Update CRM Record\"\n```\n\nThis allows us to add new automations **without touching the code of the core services**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Frontend Strategy: The \"Native PWA\" Feel\n\n**Objective:** Load instantly, transition seamlessly, never flash white.\n\n### A. The Technology Stack\n\n| Component | Technology |\n|-----------|------------|\n| **Host** | Astro (Server-Side Rendering + Client Router) |\n| **Micro-Apps** | React (bundled via Vite) |\n| **State** | Nano Stores (for cross-app UI signaling) |\n| **Data** | TanStack Query (for server-state synchronization) |\n\n### B. The Loading Strategy (Lazy Loading)\n\nWe do **not** bundle the ERP code with the CRM code.\n\n1. **Initial Load:** User downloads `shell.js` (~15kb). They see the Sidebar and Header immediately.\n2. **Interaction:** User hovers over \"CRM\".\n3. **Hydration:** Astro's router intercepts the hover. It fetches `chunk-crm.js` via `client:only=\"react\"` and mounts it hidden into the content area.\n4. **Interaction:** User clicks \"CRM\".\n5. **Hydration:** Astro's router intercepts the click. It mounts the hidden CRM app into the content area.\n6. **Transition:** The Sidebar persists. The content area transitions smoothly.\n\n### C. Routing\n\n- Routes like `/crm/*` are Astro pages that mount a specific React Island (`<CrmApp />`).\n- **Error Boundaries:** If the CRM bundle fails to load, the Shell catches the error. The Sidebar remains functional, preventing a \"White Screen of Death.\"\n\n### D. Communication (The \"Store\" Pattern)\n\nApps do **not** talk directly to each other. They talk to a shared Nano Store.\n\n**Example:** CRM updates \"Lead Status\". It calls `notifications.add()`. The Shell (listening to `notifications`) shows a toast.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Backend Strategy & Observability\n\n**Objective:** Isolation and independent scaling.\n\n### A. Containerization\n\nEach folder in `/services/*` has its own `Dockerfile`.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- **Isolation:** If the `bot-processor` crashes due to a memory leak, the `erp-engine` keeps running perfectly.\n- **Scaling:** On Black Friday, we can spin up 50 replicas of `core-api` without paying for extra `bot-processor` instances.\n\n### B. Observability\n\n| Concern | Strategy |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Logging** | Centralized (e.g., Loki/CloudWatch). No `console.log` into the void. |\n| **Tracing** | We tag every request with a `correlation_id` at the API Gateway. This ID follows the request from Frontend → API → Redis → n8n → Database, allowing us to trace a user action across the entire distributed system. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Data Strategy (Multi-Tenancy)\n\n**Objective:** Logical separation on a shared physical resource.\n\n### A. Database Topology\n\nWe will use a **Single Physical Postgres Cluster** (e.g., Supabase) but enforce **Logical Schema Isolation**.\n\n```\nDatabase: business_os_db\n├── Schema: auth           # Supabase managed\n├── Schema: public         # Users, Organizations, Tenants\n├── Schema: crm_service    # Tables: leads, pipelines, activities\n└── Schema: erp_service    # Tables: ledgers, invoices, inventory\n```\n\n### B. Schema Ownership\n\n| Rule | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Strict Rule** | Only the CRM Service can write to `crm_schema`. |\n| **Migrations** | Managed per-service (e.g., Drizzle Kit for Node, Golang Migrate for Go). |\n\n### C. The \"Shared Contract\" (`/packages/ts-schema`)\n\nTo prevent chaos, **no service is allowed to \"guess\" the shape of data**.\n\nWe maintain a shared TypeScript package that exports the Types for every API response and Event payload.\n\n**Rule:** If you change the Database Schema, you **must** update the Shared Types.\n\n### D. Multi-Tenancy (RLS)\n\n| Rule | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Strict Rule** | Every single table in every schema **MUST** have an `organization_id` column. |\n| **Enforcement** | We use Postgres Row Level Security (RLS). |\n| **Mechanism** | The API Gateway passes the User's JWT to the database connection. Postgres itself ensures Customer A never sees Customer B's data, even if the developer makes a mistake in the SQL query. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Development Workflow\n\n### \"Day 1\" Setup\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone Repo\ngit clone https://github.com/your-org/business-os-monorepo.git\n\n# 2. Install Dependencies (Turborepo installs all dependencies for all apps)\nnpm install\n\n# 3. Start Infrastructure (Postgres, Redis, and Backend Services)\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# 4. Start Frontend (Astro Shell and React watchers)\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### \"Day 100\" Deployment\n\n| Layer | Platform |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Frontend** | Vercel / Netlify (Global Edge Network) |\n| **Backend** | AWS ECS / DigitalOcean Kubernetes (Docker Containers) |\n| **Database** | Supabase / AWS RDS |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Future-Proofing Checklist\n\n- [ ] **Unified Auth:** Single JWT verification across all backend services (Supabase Auth). Ensure all backend services verify the same JWT token. Do not create separate user tables for the CRM and ERP. Use a central Identity Provider.\n\n- [ ] **API Gateway:** Unified entry point (Nginx/Kong/Traefik) routing `/api/crm` to the correct container and handling rate limiting.\n\n- [ ] **Feature Flags:** System to toggle modules (e.g., \"Enable Beta Marketing App\") per Organization.\n\n- [ ] **Billing Source of Truth:** All modules must check the Core API for license validity before executing. The CRM app must check the Core API: \"Does this user have the 'Pro' license?\" before rendering premium features.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Service Boundaries\n\n| Service | Owns | Responsibilities |\n|---------|------|------------------|\n| `core-api` | Users, Organizations, Billing | Authentication, Authorization, Subscription Management |\n| `crm-engine` | Leads, Pipelines, Activities | Contact Management, Sales Pipeline, Activity Tracking |\n| `erp-engine` | Ledgers, Invoices, Inventory | Financial Calculations, PDF Generation, Inventory Management |\n| `bot-processor` | Conversations, AI Context | LLM Chains, WhatsApp Connectivity, Sentiment Analysis |\n| `n8n-host` | Workflows, Triggers | Business Logic Orchestration, Third-Party Integrations |\n"}}

Concept\n\nThe **Calm Prompt** is the owner’s (and ops manager’s) single source of truth for:\n\n> “What actually needs my attention right now?”\n\nInstead of relying on memory, sticky notes, and dozens of tabs, Xentri derives an explicit list of **Open Loops** from the Event Backbone and presents them in a calm, prioritized view.\n\nThe Calm Prompt:\n\n- **Does not** store its own state.\n- **Does** derive state from events and entity data (deals, invoices, follow-ups).\n- Is deliberately minimal – one screen that reduces open-loop anxiety.\n- Implementation detail: the derived loops may be **materialized** into an `open_loops` projection table for fast reads, but the source of truth remains the event log + entity tables.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Defining “Open Loops” (v0.1)\n\nAn **Open Loop** is a *derived state* that:\n\n1. Can be expressed in terms of events + current entity fields.\n2. Requires some form of resolution (an action or an explicit dismissal).\n3. Is important enough to justify attention from the owner/ops role.\n\nFor v0.1 we focus on four core loop categories.\n\n### 2.1 Loop Categories (Initial Set)\n\n| Category            | Trigger Condition                                      | Resolution Condition                                 | Default Severity |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| **Quote Needed**    | `quote_requested` exists and **no** `quote_sent`      | `quote_sent` emitted for the same deal              | High             |\n| **Decision Pending**| `quote_sent` exists and **no** `quote_accepted` / `quote_rejected` | `quote_accepted` OR `quote_rejected` emitted | Medium           |\n| **Invoice Overdue** | `invoice_issued` exists, `due_date < now`, **no** `payment_received` | `payment_received` emitted for that invoice | High             |\n| **Follow-up Due**   | `followup_scheduled` date ≤ now, **no** `followup_sent` / `followup_dismissed` | `followup_sent` OR `followup_dismissed` emitted | Medium           |\n| **New Lead**        | `lead_created` exists, **no** interaction events yet | `quote_requested` OR `followup_scheduled` OR `note_added` | Medium           |\n\nNotes:\n\n- Loop state is **fully recomputable** from the underlying events and entity data.\n- Severity can later be enriched (e.g. amount, client tier), but v0.1 uses fixed defaults.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Owner Home Wireframe (Low-fi)\n\nThe Calm Prompt surfaces Open Loops in two main sections.\n\n### 3.1 Section 1 – Today’s Critical Loops (“Calm Prompt”)\n\nTop of screen. A small, card-based list of **highest-severity, time-sensitive** loops.\n\nExample cards:\n\n> **Sarah / ACME Co**  \n> 🔴 Quote Needed (Due: Tomorrow – Board Meeting)  \n> [Draft Quote] [Dismiss]\n\n> **Project Alpha / Invoice #102**  \n> 🟠 Invoice Overdue (3 days)  \n> [Resend Invoice] [Mark Paid]\n\nPrinciples:\n\n- Max 5–7 items visible here by default (no scrolling stress).\n- Actions:\n  - **Primary**: push the loop forward (e.g. “Draft Quote”, “Resend Invoice”).\n  - **Secondary**: allow explicit dismissal (`followup_dismissed`, “ignore for now”, etc.).\n\n### 3.2 Section 2 – Upcoming (Next 7 Days)\n\nBelow the critical section, lighter-weight list.\n\nExamples:\n\n- **Tomorrow:** Decision Pending – Quote for Client B (Quote Sent 2 days ago)  \n- **Wed:** Invoice #103 Due (Client C, $1,200)\n- **New Lead:** \"Client D\" (Needs acknowledgement)\n\nThis section helps the owner/ops see *what’s coming* without it competing with today’s fires.\n\n---\n\n## 4. API Definition\n\nThe Calm Prompt UI consumes a dedicated API that operates on a projection of the **Event Backbone** (e.g. `system_events` + precomputed views).\n\n### 4.1 Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/owner/open-loops`\n\nThis endpoint:\n\n- Accepts the current user/org context (e.g. via JWT).\n- Applies the loop rules in §2.1.\n- Returns two main buckets: `critical` and `upcoming`.\n\n**Response (example):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"critical\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"loop_123\",\n      \"type\": \"quote_needed\",\n      \"client_name\": \"Sarah / ACME Co\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"deal\",\n      \"entity_id\": \"deal_456\",\n      \"due_at\": \"2025-11-25T10:00:00Z\",\n      \"severity\": \"high\",\n      \"suggested_action\": \"draft_quote\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"loop_124\",\n      \"type\": \"invoice_overdue\",\n      \"client_name\": \"Project Alpha / Client X\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"invoice\",\n      \"entity_id\": \"inv_102\",\n      \"due_at\": \"2025-11-20T00:00:00Z\",\n      \"severity\": \"high\",\n      \"suggested_action\": \"resend_invoice\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"upcoming\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"loop_200\",\n      \"type\": \"decision_pending\",\n      \"client_name\": \"Client B\",\n      \"entity_type\": \"deal\",\n      \"entity_id\": \"deal_789\",\n      \"due_at\": \"2025-11-26T10:00:00Z\",\n      \"severity\": \"medium\",\n      \"suggested_action\": \"check_in\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nLater extensions might include:\n\t•\tPagination / cursor support.\n\t•\tFilters by loop type, client, amount.\n\t•\tSeparate endpoints for different roles (e.g. owner vs team member).\n\n5. Implementation Strategy (v0.1)\n\n5.1 Backend – LoopService\n\t•\tReads from:\n\t•\tsystem_events (append-only event log)\n\t•\tCore entities (deals, invoices, followups) in the Core API.\n\t•\tApplies the loop rules from §2.1:\n\t•\tEvaluates trigger + resolution conditions.\n\t•\tComputes due_at, severity, and suggested_action (simple mapping table).\n\t•\tExposes:\n\t•\tGET /api/v1/owner/open-loops (as above).\n\nThe LoopService does not mutate core entities; it purely derives and aggregates.\n\n5.2 Frontend – Calm Prompt Dashboard\n\t•\tA single dashboard component in the Shell (Owner Home).\n\t•\tResponsibilities:\n\t•\tCall GET /api/v1/owner/open-loops.\n\t•\tRender:\n\t•\t“Today’s Critical Loops” cards.\n\t•\t“Upcoming (Next 7 Days)” list.\n\t•\tDispatch actions to other modules:\n\t•\te.g. “Draft Quote” opens the Deals/Quotes UI.\n\t•\t“Resend Invoice” calls the Billing module.\n\t•\t“Dismiss” emits a followup_dismissed or equivalent event.\n\nThe Calm Prompt itself remains visually calm and functionally thin – it orchestrates attention, not business logic.\n\n⸻\n\n6. Extensibility (Future Loops, v0.2+)\n\nv0.1 intentionally ships with a small, high-impact set of Open Loops.\n\nFuture versions can add more categories, for example:\n\t•\tOnboarding Stuck: client created but no first project started within N days.\n\t•\tProject at Risk: project with overdue tasks and high value.\n\t•\tRetention Risk: key client with no interaction in N days.\n\nAll future loops must follow the same pattern:\n\nDefine in terms of events + entity state → derive → show → resolve via explicit actions.\n"}}

Overview\n\nThe **Event Backbone** is the nervous system of Xentri OS.  \nInstead of only storing “current state” (deals, invoices, etc.), Xentri records **what happened** as a stream of events.\n\nFor v0.1, we implement this as a **log-based architecture** using an append-only table in Postgres.  \nFuture versions can project this log into other systems (Redis, Kafka, n8n), but the core contract stays the same. This keeps the Postgres log as the **system of record**, while aligning with the broader architecture’s two-layer event system (Redis Streams for transport, n8n for orchestration) via an outbox-style publisher.\n\n**Key invariants:**\n\n- Events are **append-only**: no in-place updates, no logical deletes.\n- Corrections happen by **emitting new events**, not editing history.\n- Every event is **scoped to an org** and references a primary entity.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Event Schema\n\nEvery event in the system must conform to this structure.\n\n### 2.1 Database Schema (Postgres)\n\nTable: `system_events`\n\n| Column               | Type        | Description                                       |\n|----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| `id`                 | UUID        | Unique event ID                                   |\n| `org_id`             | UUID        | Multi-tenant isolation                            |\n| `event_type`         | VARCHAR     | e.g. `lead_created`, `quote_sent`                |\n| `occurred_at`        | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the event actually happened (business time)  |\n| `actor_id`           | UUID        | User/System/Client ID that caused it             |\n| `actor_type`         | VARCHAR     | `user`, `system`, or `client`                    |\n| `primary_entity_id`  | UUID        | ID of the main object (deal, invoice, client…)   |\n| `primary_entity_type`| VARCHAR     | e.g. `deal`, `invoice`, `client`, `followup`     |\n| `payload`            | JSONB       | Context-specific details                          |\n| `created_at`         | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the record was inserted (storage time)      |\n\n**Indexing (v0.1):**\n\n- `idx_system_events_org_occurred_at (org_id, occurred_at DESC)`\n- `idx_system_events_entity (primary_entity_type, primary_entity_id, occurred_at DESC)`\n- `idx_system_events_type (event_type, org_id)`\n\nThese support:\n\n- org-wide feeds / analytics,\n- per-entity timelines,\n- loop detection (by event type).\n\n### 2.2 TypeScript Contract\n\n(To be shared via `packages/ts-schema`)\n\n```typescript\nexport type EventActorType = 'user' | 'system' | 'client';\n\nexport type PrimaryEntityType =\n  | 'deal'\n  | 'invoice'\n  | 'client'\n  | 'followup'; // extend as new modules are added\n\nexport type EventType =\n  | 'lead_created'\n  | 'quote_requested'\n  | 'quote_sent'\n  | 'quote_accepted'\n  | 'quote_rejected'\n  | 'invoice_issued'\n  | 'payment_received'\n  | 'followup_scheduled'\n  | 'followup_sent'\n  | 'followup_dismissed'\n  | 'note_added'; // from Inbox\n\nexport interface SystemEvent<T = any> {\n  id: string;\n  org_id: string;\n  event_type: EventType;\n  occurred_at: string; // ISO8601 timestamp (business time)\n  actor: {\n    id: string;\n    type: EventActorType;\n  };\n  primary_entity: {\n    id: string;\n    type: PrimaryEntityType;\n  };\n  payload: T;\n  created_at?: string; // storage time, optional for most clients\n}\n\nNotes:\n\t•\tClients should normally care about occurred_at (business time).\n\t•\tcreated_at is mostly useful for debugging ingestion delays.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Initial Event Catalog (v0.1)\n\nThis catalog covers the minimum needed for:\n\t•\tXentri Inbox v0.1 (tagging leads / quote requests, adding notes),\n\t•\tCalm Prompt & Open Loops v0.1 (quotes, decisions, invoices, follow-ups).\n\n3.1 Lead & Deal Events\n\t•\tlead_created\nNew potential client identified (from website form, Inbox, manual entry).\n\t•\tquote_requested\nClient asks for pricing/scope (often from Inbox tagging or form).\n\t•\tquote_sent\nProposal / quote delivered to client (email, PDF, etc.).\n\t•\tquote_accepted\nDeal won (client has explicitly accepted).\n\t•\tquote_rejected\nDeal lost (client declined or request withdrawn).\n\n3.2 Invoice & Payment Events\n\t•\tinvoice_issued\nOfficial demand for payment sent to client.\n\t•\tpayment_received\nPayment recorded (automatically via integration or manually).\n\n3.3 Communication & Follow-up Events\n\t•\tfollowup_scheduled\nSystem or user plans a future touchpoint (e.g. “remind tomorrow”).\n\t•\tfollowup_sent\nFollow-up message actually delivered.\n\t•\tfollowup_dismissed\nFollow-up intentionally cancelled / marked as not needed.\n\t•\tnote_added\nNote added to a client/deal/follow-up timeline (often from Inbox).\n\nFuture versions will extend this catalog with:\n\t•\tmessage_ingested, support_ticket_created, booking_requested, etc.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Read API Patterns\n\nThese APIs will power timelines, feeds, and the Calm Prompt.\n\n4.1 Get Events by Org\n\nGET /api/v1/events?start_date=...&end_date=...\n\t•\tScope: current org inferred from auth token.\n\t•\tUse cases:\n\t•\tActivity feeds,\n\t•\tAnalytics / reporting,\n\t•\tDebugging “what happened yesterday?”.\n\nOptional parameters:\n\t•\tevent_type\n\t•\tlimit / cursor\n\n4.2 Get Events by Entity\n\nGET /api/v1/events?entity_type=deal&entity_id=...\n\t•\tUse cases:\n\t•\tDeal Timeline view,\n\t•\tClient history,\n\t•\tInvoice-specific audit.\n\nVariants (for clarity later):\n\t•\tGET /api/v1/entities/:entity_type/:entity_id/events\n\nThe Calm Prompt / LoopService will generally not call these directly; it will typically rely on precomputed projections or dedicated queries, but the patterns above define the baseline.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Technical Implementation Plan (v0.1)\n\t1.\tCreate migration for system_events table\n\t•\tSchema as in §2.1.\n\t•\tInclude indexes listed there.\n\t2.\tCreate EventService in Core API\n\t•\tResponsibilities:\n\t•\tValidate incoming events (org, event_type, primary_entity).\n\t•\tInsert into system_events table.\n\t•\tOptionally emit hooks to internal subscribers (e.g. LoopService) later.\n\t•\tProvide a simple emitEvent() function used across services.\n\t3.\tWire up initial event emitters\n\t•\tFrom Xentri Inbox (v0.1):\n\t•\tOn “Mark as Lead” → emit lead_created.\n\t•\tOn “Mark as Quote Request” → emit quote_requested.\n\t•\tOn “Add Note” → emit note_added.\n\t•\tFrom Deals/Quotes module:\n\t•\tOn quote creation/send → emit quote_sent.\n\t•\tOn accept/reject → emit quote_accepted / quote_rejected.\n\t•\tFrom Invoicing module:\n\t•\tOn invoice creation/send → emit invoice_issued.\n\t•\tOn payment record → emit payment_received.\n\t•\tFrom Follow-up logic:\n\t•\tScheduling → followup_scheduled.\n\t•\tSending → followup_sent.\n\t•\tCancelling/ignoring → followup_dismissed.\n\t4.\tExpose initial read endpoints\n\t•\tImplement endpoints described in §4.1 and §4.2.\n\t•\tUse them to power:\n\t•\tper-entity timelines in the UI,\n\t•\tinitial LoopService / Calm Prompt implementation.\n\t5.\tDocument usage guidelines\n\t•\tShort dev note:\n\t•\t“When you change important business state, also emit an event.”\n\t•\t“Never modify or delete existing events; emit compensating events instead.”\n\t6.\tPublish to the transport layer (per architecture)\n\t•\tOutbox pattern from Postgres → Redis Streams for cross-service transport.\n\t•\tn8n subscribes as the logic layer; Postgres remains the source of truth.\n"}}

Overview\n\nXentri Inbox is **one of the first wedge modules** for Xentri OS.  \nIts job is to be the entry point for **messy, conversational reality** (messages, form submissions, copy-pasted WhatsApp/email) and turn it into structured events the OS can understand.\n\nInbox does **not** try to be a full CRM. It is a **classification surface**:\n\n> Messages in → human tagging → events out → Open Loops updated.\n\nIt complements the **Website + CMS** module (which creates leads via forms and pages) by centralizing and structuring incoming messages.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Scope (v0.1)\n\nFor v0.1, Xentri Inbox focuses on **manual ingestion and classification** with minimal automation.\n\n### 2.1 Inputs\n\n- **Website Contact Form (from Xentri Site/CMS):**\n  - New form submissions are stored in a `messages` table and appear in Inbox automatically.\n- **Manual Entry:**\n  - “Log a message” flow where the user can paste:\n    - WhatsApp messages\n    - Email content\n    - Notes from a call\n\nFuture versions (v0.2+) may add **direct connectors** (WhatsApp, email, Instagram, etc.), but v0.1 assumes manual copy-paste for non-site channels.\n\n### 2.2 Core Actions (Tagging Flow)\n\nThe user reads a message and chooses an action. Each action emits an event into the Event Backbone.\n\n1. **\"Mark as Lead\"**\n   - If the sender is new:\n     - Creates a `Client` entity (via Core API).\n   - Emits: `lead_created`\n   - Links message → client.\n\n2. **\"Mark as Quote Request\"**\n   - Opens a simple “Draft Deal” modal:\n     - client (pre-filled if known),\n     - short description,\n     - optional value/notes.\n   - On save:\n     - Emits: `quote_requested`\n     - Optionally creates a `Deal` entity via Core API.\n\n3. **\"Add Note\"**\n   - Adds a note attached to the client/message context.\n   - Emits: `note_added` (for the client timeline)\n   - Does **not** create an open loop by itself.\n\n4. **\"Ignore / Archive\"**\n   - Marks the message as handled with no event emission.\n   - Used for spam, irrelevant or resolved messages.\n\n(If we keep a `Log Task` action for v0.1, we can add: `task_created` here as a 5th action; otherwise leave tasks for a later iteration.)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mapping Inbox → Events → Open Loops\n\nInbox **only** emits events.  \nThe **Calm Prompt / Open Loops service** interprets those events to derive what needs attention.\n\n| User Action in Inbox         | Event Emitted     | Resulting Open Loop (Calm Prompt)         |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Click \"Mark as Quote Request\"| `quote_requested` | **Quote Needed** (appears as open loop)   |\n| Click \"Mark as Lead\"        | `lead_created`    | **New Lead** (in lists / upcoming)        |\n| Click \"Add Note\"            | `note_added`      | None (enriches timeline only)             |\n| Click \"Ignore / Archive\"    | —                 | None                                      |\n\nLater versions can extend this mapping (e.g. `support_request_created`, `booking_requested`, etc.), but v0.1 stays focused on **leads and quote requests**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. UI Sketch (Owner / Team View)\n\n### 4.1 Layout: 2-Pane Split\n\n- **Left Pane – Conversation / Message List**\n  - Tabs or filters:\n    - All\n    - New\n    - Leads\n    - Quote Requests\n    - Archived\n  - Each item shows:\n    - Sender / client name (or “Unknown”)\n    - Source (Website, Manual)\n    - Time\n    - Status (Tagged / Untagged)\n\n- **Right Pane – Message Detail + Action Bar**\n  - Full message content (body, form fields, any attachments metadata)\n  - Context:\n    - Linked client (if exists)\n    - Past messages from same client (optional v0.1.5+)\n  - **Action Bar** at the top:\n    > [Mark as Lead] [Mark as Quote Request] [Add Note] [Archive]\n\n  - Optional UX detail:\n    - When the user selects text in the message, the relevant actions highlight, but v0.1 can work without selection awareness.\n\nThe goal is to let the owner (or team) clear the Inbox by **turning messages into events or archiving them**, without leaving this screen.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Module Boundaries\n\nTo keep Xentri Inbox focused and maintainable:\n\n- **Inbox Module:**\n  - **Reads from:** `messages` table (raw inputs from Website forms + manual entries).\n  - **Writes to:** `system_events` (via Core API).\n  - Does **not**:\n    - implement deal pipelines,\n    - implement invoicing logic,\n    - own the client schema.\n\n- **Core API / Other Modules:**\n  - Own the actual `Client`, `Deal`, `Invoice` entities.\n  - Compute and expose:\n    - Open Loops (through a dedicated endpoint),\n    - timelines per client/deal,\n    - capacity or financial views.\n\nInbox is intentionally a **thin wedge**:  \nit’s the UI where messy messages first become structured events, feeding the Event Backbone and, through that, the Calm Prompt and other Xentri OS capabilities."}}

No code yet. The most inevitable next move is to ship a thin, end-to-end slice that proves the architecture and the value: ingest a message, emit an event, derive an open loop, surface it in the Calm Prompt UI. That’s the smallest thing that touches every layer you care about.\n\n- Core bet: make the event log the source of truth, not an afterthought. If we wire that now, everything else (n8n, transports, projections) slots in cleanly later. Any other order risks bolting events on as plumbing.\n- Outcome: owner opens the app and immediately sees “Quote Needed” and “Invoice Overdue” derived from real events—not mock data. That’s the heart of Xentri.\n\n**Proposed plan (high conviction)**  \n1) Data spine: Add `system_events` migration + TypeScript contract (`packages/ts-schema`) so every service emits the same shape.  \n2) Emitters: Stub emit hooks in Inbox/Deals/Invoicing surfaces (even as no-op functions) to enforce “business change ⇒ event” discipline.  \n3) LoopService: Small service/module that reads events + entity tables, applies the v0.1 rules, and exposes `GET /api/v1/owner/open-loops` (critical/upcoming buckets).  \n4) Calm Prompt UI: A single Astro/React page that calls that endpoint and renders the two sections from the product doc, with actionable buttons wired to module intents (draft quote, resend invoice, dismiss).  \n5) Tests/contracts: Minimal contract tests around event types and loop derivation rules so we can refactor safely as catalogs grow.\n\n**If you want a choice of tracks, pick one number and I’ll execute:**  \n1) Ship the Event Backbone + LoopService + Calm Prompt slice (recommended).  \n2) Build the Inbox tagging UI (2-pane) wired to emit events (with stubbed backend).  \n3) Lock down the shared TS schema package and validation layer only, to unblock all services.\n\nTell me the track, and I’ll sketch the architecture in-repo and start crafting it."}}

No code yet. The most inevitable next move is to ship a thin, end-to-end slice that proves the architecture and the value: ingest a message, emit an event, derive an open loop, surface it in the Calm Prompt UI. That’s the smallest thing that touches every layer you care about.\n\n- Core bet: make the event log the source of truth, not an afterthought. If we wire that now, everything else (n8n, transports, projections) slots in cleanly later. Any other order risks bolting events on as plumbing.\n- Outcome: owner opens the app and immediately sees “Quote Needed” and “Invoice Overdue” derived from real events—not mock data. That’s the heart of Xentri.\n\n**Proposed plan (high conviction)**  \n1) Data spine: Add `system_events` migration + TypeScript contract (`packages/ts-schema`) so every service emits the same shape.  \n2) Emitters: Stub emit hooks in Inbox/Deals/Invoicing surfaces (even as no-op functions) to enforce “business change ⇒ event” discipline.  \n3) LoopService: Small service/module that reads events + entity tables, applies the v0.1 rules, and exposes `GET /api/v1/owner/open-loops` (critical/upcoming buckets).  \n4) Calm Prompt UI: A single Astro/React page that calls that endpoint and renders the two sections from the product doc, with actionable buttons wired to module intents (draft quote, resend invoice, dismiss).  \n5) Tests/contracts: Minimal contract tests around event types and loop derivation rules so we can refactor safely as catalogs grow.\n\n**If you want a choice of tracks, pick one number and I’ll execute:**  \n1) Ship the Event Backbone + LoopService + Calm Prompt slice (recommended).  \n2) Build the Inbox tagging UI (2-pane) wired to emit events (with stubbed backend).  \n3) Lock down the shared TS schema package and validation layer only, to unblock all services.\n\nTell me the track, and I’ll sketch the architecture in-repo and start crafting it."}]}}

without YAML syntax errors\n- [ ] instructions.md file exists and is properly formatted\n- [ ] template.md file exists (if document workflow) with valid markdown\n- [ ] All critical headers present in instructions (workflow engine reference, workflow.yaml reference)\n- [ ] Workflow type correctly identified (document/action/interactive/autonomous/meta)\n- [ ] All referenced files actually exist at specified paths\n- [ ] No placeholder text remains (like {TITLE}, {WORKFLOW_CODE}, TODO, etc.)\n\n## Standard Config Block\n\n- [ ] workflow.yaml contains `config_source` pointing to correct module config\n- [ ] `output_folder` pulls from `{config_source}:output_folder`\n- [ ] `user_name` pulls from `{config_source}:user_name`\n- [ ] `communication_language` pulls from `{config_source}:communication_language`\n- [ ] `date` is set to `system-generated`\n- [ ] Config source uses {project-root} variable (not hardcoded path)\n- [ ] Standard config comment present: \"Critical variables from config\"\n\n## Config Variable Usage\n\n- [ ] Instructions communicate in {communication_language} where appropriate\n- [ ] Instructions address {user_name} in greetings or summaries where appropriate\n- [ ] All file outputs write to {output_folder} or subdirectories (no hardcoded paths)\n- [ ] Template includes {{user_name}} in metadata (optional for document workflows)\n- [ ] Template includes {{date}} in metadata (optional for document workflows)\n- [ ] Template does NOT use {{communication_language}} in headers (agent-only variable)\n- [ ] No hardcoded language-specific text that should use {communication_language}\n- [ ] Date used for agent date awareness (not confused with training cutoff)\n\n## YAML/Instruction/Template Alignment\n\n- [ ] Every workflow.yaml variable (excluding standard config) is used in instructions OR template\n- [ ] No unused yaml fields present (bloat removed)\n- [ ] No duplicate fields between top-level and web_bundle section\n- [ ] All template variables ({{variable}}) have corresponding yaml definitions OR <template-output> tags\n- [ ] All <template-output> tags have corresponding template variables (if document workflow)\n- [ ] Template variables use snake_case naming convention\n- [ ] Variable names are descriptive (not abbreviated like {{puj}} instead of {{primary_user_journey}})\n- [ ] No hardcoded values in instructions that should be yaml variables\n\n## Web Bundle Validation (if applicable)\n\n- [ ] web_bundle section present if workflow needs deployment\n- [ ] All paths in web_bundle use .bmad/-relative format (NOT {project-root})\n- [ ] No {config_source} variables in web_bundle section\n- [ ] instructions file listed in web_bundle_files array\n- [ ] template file listed in web_bundle_files (if document workflow)\n- [ ] validation/checklist file listed in web_bundle_files (if exists)\n- [ ] All data files (CSV, JSON, YAML) listed in web_bundle_files\n- [ ] All <invoke-workflow> called workflows have their .yaml files in web_bundle_files\n- [ ] **CRITICAL**: If workflow invokes other workflows, existing_workflows field is present\n- [ ] existing_workflows maps workflow variables to .bmad/-relative paths correctly\n- [ ] All files referenced in instructions <action> tags listed in web_bundle_files\n- [ ] No files listed in web_bundle_files that don't exist\n- [ ] Web bundle metadata (name, description, author) matches top-level metadata\n\n## Template Validation (if document workflow)\n\n- [ ] Template variables match <template-output> tags in instructions exactly\n- [ ] All required sections present in template structure\n- [ ] Template uses {{variable}} syntax (double curly braces)\n- [ ] Template variables use snake_case (not camelCase or PascalCase)\n- [ ] Standard metadata header format correct (optional usage of {{date}}, {{user_name}})\n- [ ] No placeholders remain in template (like {SECTION_NAME})\n- [ ] Template structure matches document purpose\n\n## Instructions Quality\n\n- [ ] Each step has n=\"X\" attribute with sequential numbering\n- [ ] Each step has goal=\"clear goal statement\" attribute\n- [ ] Optional steps marked with optional=\"true\"\n- [ ] Repeating steps have appropriate repeat attribute (repeat=\"3\", repeat=\"for-each-X\", repeat=\"until-approved\")\n- [ ] Conditional steps have if=\"condition\" attribute\n- [ ] XML tags used correctly (<action>, <ask>, <check>, <goto>, <invoke-workflow>, <template-output>)\n- [ ] No nested tag references in content (use \"action tags\" not \"<action> tags\")\n- [ ] Tag references use descriptive text without angle brackets for clarity\n- [ ] No conditional execution antipattern (no self-closing <check> tags)\n- [ ] Single conditionals use <action if=\"condition\"> (inline)\n- [ ] Multiple conditionals use <check if=\"condition\">...</check> (wrapper block with closing tag)\n- [ ] Steps are focused (single goal per step)\n- [ ] Instructions are specific with limits (\"Write 1-2 paragraphs\" not \"Write about\")\n- [ ] Examples provided where helpful\n- [ ] <template-output> tags save checkpoints for document workflows\n- [ ] Flow control is logical and clear\n\n## Bloat Detection\n\n- [ ] Bloat percentage under 10% (unused yaml fields / total fields)\n- [ ] No commented-out variables that should be removed\n- [ ] No duplicate metadata between sections\n- [ ] No variables defined but never referenced\n- [ ] No redundant configuration that duplicates web_bundle\n\n## Final Validation\n\n### Critical Issues (Must fix immediately)\n\n_List any critical issues found:_\n\n- Issue 1:\n- Issue 2:\n- Issue 3:\n\n### Important Issues (Should fix soon)\n\n_List any important issues found:_\n\n- Issue 1:\n- Issue 2:\n- Issue 3:\n\n### Cleanup Recommendations (Nice to have)\n\n_List any cleanup recommendations:_\n\n- Recommendation 1:\n- Recommendation 2:\n- Recommendation 3:\n\n---\n\n## Audit Summary\n\n**Total Checks:**\n**Passed:** {total}\n**Failed:** {total}\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- Pass Rate ≥ 95%: Excellent - Ready for production\n- Pass Rate 85-94%: Good - Minor fixes needed\n- Pass Rate 70-84%: Fair - Important issues to address\n- Pass Rate < 70%: Poor - Significant work required\n\n---\n\n**Audit Completed:** {{date}}\n**Auditor:** Audit Workflow (BMAD v6)\n"}}

In other words:\n\n  # Xentri – Brand Guidelines (v0.2, First Principles Draft)\n\n  > Working name: **Xentri**  \n  > These guidelines describe the brand foundations for the Business OS project.  \n  > If the project is renamed later, treat \"Xentri\" as a placeholder and update accordingly.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 1. Brand Core\n\n  ### 1.1 Problem From First Principles\n\n  - Small businesses and agencies run on **workflows**, not tools: lead → quote → project → invoice → payment → reporting.\n  - Today those workflows are split across **unrelated SaaS tools**, ad-hoc spreadsheets, and messaging apps (often WhatsApp).\n  - The real pain is not “missing features” but:\n    - **Fragmented state** (no single source of truth),\n    - **Manual glue work** (copy/paste, exports, screenshots),\n    - **Invisible automations** (things happen but nobody knows how or why).\n  - Owners care about **control and clarity** more than “AI magic.”\n  - Any solution that doesn’t respect **multi-tenant reality, accounting correctness, and permissions** will be rejected in practice.\n\n  ### 1.2 First-Principles Solution\n\n  From those fundamentals:\n\n  - Xentri is **not** “just another CRM or ERP.”\n  - Xentri is:\n    - A **unified shell**: one calm workspace instead of ten tabs.\n    - A **consistent data model**: clients, projects, invoices, and conversations all line up.\n    - An **event-driven backbone**: everything important (a deal closing, an invoice being paid, a bot sending a message) is an explicit event.\n    - A **visible automation layer**: workflows are inspectable, explainable, and correctable.\n    - An **AI operations brain**: the system can propose and trigger next actions across flows, based on the live state of the business.\n\n  > **Xentri is the operating system and AI brain for small businesses and agencies: one workspace, one data model, and one automation layer for the flows that actually run the business.**\n\n  ### 1.3 Refined One-Liner\n\n  > **Run your whole business with Xentri OS and Xentri’s AI operations brain – Xentri connects CRM, ERP, billing, and automations so your small or medium business can run day-to-day operations from a single workspace.**\n\n  ### 1.4 Refined Elevator Pitch\n\n  Most small businesses and agencies don’t suffer from a lack of tools; they suffer from tools that don’t agree with each other.\n\n  Leads live in one app, invoices in another, tasks in a third, and critical decisions happen in WhatsApp threads and owner memory.\n\n  Xentri starts from a different premise:\n\n  - The business has a **small number of critical flows** that must always work: from first contact to paid invoice (and beyond).\n  - Those flows deserve **one operating system and one AI brain**, not a chain of brittle integrations.\n\n  With Xentri:\n\n  - The team works in a **single shell** that feels like a native desktop app, not a pile of tabs.\n  - CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots are **modules** on a shared data model and event system.\n  - Every automation—whether it’s creating an invoice, updating a status, or sending a reminder—is **logged and explainable**.\n  - The AI layer acts as an **operations brain**: suggesting and orchestrating next actions so day-to-day work keeps flowing with less manual oversight.\n\n  Result: operators get calm, predictable control; owners get a trustworthy picture of the business; AI becomes infrastructure for daily operations, not a gimmick.\n\n  ### 1.5 Brand Promise\n\n  > **“Bring your business tools into Xentri, and run every critical flow from one place.”**\n\n  ### 1.6 Brand Pillars (Tightened)\n\n  1. **Unity of Workflows** – From lead to invoice, flows live in one system, on one schema.\n  2. **Calm Control** – No drama: clear states, predictable automations, stable UI.\n  3. **Visible Automation** – Every automated action is logged, explainable, and overridable.\n  4. **Operational Reality** – Built for multi-tenant ledgers, permissions, and real-world constraints from day one.\n  5. **Localization-Ready** – Copy, UX, and data model are designed to work across languages and markets.\n\n  ### 1.7 Key Personas (Empathy Map)\n\n  #### Persona 1 – Owner / Founder (S/MB or Agency Lead)\n\n  **Thinks**\n\n  - “Everything depends on me seeing the whole picture.”\n  - “We have the tools, but no single place to trust.”\n  - “If I step away, will things still move?”\n\n  **Feels**\n\n  - Proud of the business, but mentally overloaded.\n  - Anxious about dropped balls, missed invoices, and unread threads.\n  - Skeptical of “AI magic,” open to help that feels controllable.\n\n  **Sees**\n\n  - Staff hopping between CRM, spreadsheets, billing apps, WhatsApp.\n  - Different numbers for “revenue” in different tools.\n  - Automations that no one fully understands or owns.\n\n  **Says**\n\n  - “Why am I hearing about this problem so late?”\n  - “Can someone show me what’s really going on this week?”\n  - “I don’t want more tools. I want one place where I can see and steer.”\n\n  **Does**\n\n  - Checks multiple dashboards and chats to piece together reality.\n  - Manually nudges people to follow up or send invoices.\n  - Tries new tools, abandons them when they add complexity.\n\n  **Pains**\n\n  - No single source of truth.\n  - Fear of missing something critical (payments, client issues).\n  - High dependency on specific people’s memory and personal systems.\n\n  **Gains (with Xentri)**\n\n  - One calm workspace that shows the real state of the business at a glance.\n  - Xentri’s AI operations brain keeps the core flows (lead → quote → project → invoice → payment) moving automatically, and surfaces what needs their attention today.\n  - Confidence that things keep moving even when they are offline or travelling.\n\n  ---\n\n  #### Persona 2 – Operations / General Manager (“Integrator”)\n\n  **Thinks**\n\n  - “If the workflow is clear, the team can execute.”\n  - “Right now I’m the human router between tools and people.”\n  - “I need systems that scale beyond my personal spreadsheets.”\n\n  **Feels**\n\n  - Responsible for “how the business actually runs.”\n  - Frustrated by brittle integrations and hidden automations.\n  - Motivated by clean processes and visible ownership.\n\n  **Sees**\n\n  - Teams creating their own side-systems (Notion, sheets, private boards).\n  - Automation rules scattered across tools (Zapier, Make, native automations).\n  - Repeated bottlenecks at the same stages of the flow.\n\n  **Says**\n\n  - “Where does this data actually come from?”\n  - “Who owns this step in the process?”\n  - “If we change this, what else breaks?”\n\n  **Does**\n\n  - Builds and maintains integrations, templates, SOPs.\n  - Reconciles data between systems at end of week/month.\n  - Translates leadership priorities into tasks across tools.\n\n  **Pains**\n\n  - Being the single point of failure for process knowledge.\n  - Debugging invisible automations when something silently fails.\n  - Wasting time reconciling data instead of improving flows.\n\n  **Gains (with Xentri)**\n\n  - One OS where end-to-end flows are modeled explicitly and can be improved centrally instead of in ten tools.\n  - An automation log that shows what Xentri (AI + workflows) did, when, and why, so debugging is transparent.\n  - Xentri takes over the routine routing, updates and reconciliations, so ops can focus on designing and improving processes instead of being the human glue.\n\n  ---\n\n  #### Persona 3 – Client-Facing Lead (Account / Project Lead)\n\n  **Thinks**\n\n  - “My job is to keep clients happy and work moving.”\n  - “I spend too much time chasing information.”\n  - “I don’t care which tool, I care about not dropping the ball.”\n\n  **Feels**\n\n  - Stressed by context switching and fragmented information.\n  - Embarrassed when the team misses follow-ups or invoices.\n  - Relieved when there’s a clear, reliable system.\n\n  **Sees**\n\n  - Client info scattered: email in one place, invoices in another, tasks in a third.\n  - Different stakeholders giving different answers about status.\n  - Last-minute scrambles before client meetings.\n\n  **Says**\n\n  - “Where’s the latest on this client?”\n  - “Did we actually send that invoice?”\n  - “Can someone please unify this view?”\n\n  **Does**\n\n  - Rebuilds client timelines from email, chat, and tools.\n  - Creates personal checklists to compensate for system gaps.\n  - Pings ops/finance for status updates.\n\n  **Pains**\n\n  - Losing time to hunting and re-stating context.\n  - Feeling responsible for errors caused by the system, not them.\n  - Lack of trust in dashboards vs “asking around.”\n\n  **Gains (with Xentri)**\n\n  - One client view with conversations, deals, projects, invoices and automations in a single place.\n  - An AI assistant in Xentri that tells them “what’s next” for each client and each day, so follow-ups and invoicing don’t depend on their memory.\n  - Confidence that important steps won’t fall through the cracks, even when they’re context switching.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 2. Brand Personality\n\n  If Xentri were a person, it would be:\n\n  - **Analytical but human** – understands workflows and numbers, but speaks plainly.\n  - **Calm and composed** – no hype, no panic, just steady progress.\n  - **Quietly powerful** – does heavy lifting behind the scenes, without showing off.\n  - **Trustworthy and transparent** – automation is explainable, not magic.\n\n  Avoid personalities like:\n\n  - The loud “growth hacker” promising to 10x everything overnight.\n  - The jargon-heavy consultant who hides simple ideas behind complex language.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 3. Voice & Tone\n\n  ### 3.1 Principles\n\n  1. **Plain, clear English**  \n     - Write for busy operators and owners.\n     - Short sentences. Concrete nouns. Few buzzwords.\n\n  2. **Confident, not arrogant**  \n     - We know what we’re doing, but we don’t promise miracles.\n     - Say: “Xentri reduces errors and copy-paste work,” not “eliminates all problems forever.”\n\n  3. **Calm and reassuring**  \n     - Focus on stability, consistency, and clarity.\n     - Avoid fear tactics and fake urgency.\n\n  4. **Localization-friendly**  \n     - Use language that will translate cleanly later.\n     - Avoid idioms and jokes that only make sense in one culture.\n\n  ### 3.2 Writing Examples\n\n  **Good (homepage hero):**\n\n  > Run your business from one workspace.  \n  > Xentri connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots so your team always works in sync.\n\n  **Bad (too hype):**\n\n  > Smash chaos with our AI super-suite and 10x your growth in a week!\n\n  **Good (feature explanation):**\n\n  > When a deal is marked as won, Xentri can create the project, schedule tasks, and issue the invoice.  \n  > You can see every step in the automation log.\n\n  **Bad (too vague / magical):**\n\n  > Our AI takes care of everything behind the scenes. Just sit back and relax.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 4. Visual Identity (v0.1)\n\n  These are starting points for design; they will evolve with real UI work.\n\n  ### 4.1 Color Direction\n\n  Concept: **Orchestrated calm.**\n\n  - **Base:** Deep neutral (charcoal / ink) for backgrounds or major chrome.\n  - **Primary accent:** A modern blue or teal that suggests clarity and flow.\n  - **Secondary accents:** Soft gradients or subtle secondary colors for CRM vs ERP vs Bots.\n\n  Usage:\n\n  - Use color to signal **state** (success, warning, error) and **hierarchy**, not decoration.\n  - Each core module can lean on a slightly different accent shade while keeping the overall look cohesive.\n\n  ### 4.2 Typography\n\n  Goals:\n\n  - Highly legible for tables, metrics, and forms.\n  - Works across many locales and screen sizes.\n\n  Suggestions:\n\n  - **Headings:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar).\n  - **Body text:** Same family, regular weight, 14–16px for readability.\n\n  Rules:\n\n  - Keep titles short and scannable.\n  - Avoid over-styling; let whitespace and hierarchy do most of the work.\n\n  ### 4.3 Iconography & Illustration\n\n  - Icons should be simple and consistent, ideally line-based or minimal solid icons.\n  - Avoid cartoon mascots and over-cute elements.\n  - If using illustrations, prefer abstract representations of flows, nodes, or grids rather than generic “businesspeople with laptops.”\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 5. Product UX Principles\n\n  1. **One Shell, Many Apps**  \n     - The sidebar and header are stable anchors across CRM, ERP, Billing, and Bots.\n     - Switching between modules should feel like changing panels, not switching websites.\n\n  2. **Keep Context With the User**  \n     - From any client record, you should be able to see related deals, invoices, tasks, and automations without opening five tabs.\n\n  3. **Explain Automations**  \n     - Every automated action (sending an invoice, updating a status, posting a message) should be visible and traceable.\n     - Provide an “automation log” or similar view.\n\n  4. **Multi-Tenant Safety by Design**  \n     - Make organization boundaries obvious.\n     - Never make it easy to confuse data between orgs or clients.\n\n  5. **Design for Everyday Use, Not Demos**  \n     - Optimize for the daily workflows of small agencies and businesses:\n       - Lead → quote → project → invoice → payment.\n     - Fancy dashboards are secondary to clean, efficient flows.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 6. Naming System (Modules & Sub-Brands)\n\n  Assuming **Xentri** as master brand:\n\n  - **Platform:** Xentri OS\n  - **Modules:**\n    - **Xentri CRM** – Leads, pipelines, activities, deals.\n    - **Xentri ERP** – Invoices, ledgers, inventory, suppliers.\n    - **Xentri Billing** – Subscriptions, one-off invoices, payment status.\n    - **Xentri Bots** – AI assistants, chatbots, workflow automations.\n    - **Xentri Core** – Auth, organizations, users, plans, multi-tenancy.\n\n  Guidelines:\n\n  - Use full module names in documentation and marketing.\n  - Inside the app, you can shorten to **CRM**, **ERP**, **Billing**, **Bots**, **Core** once users are oriented.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 7. Example Taglines & Messaging\n\n  Short taglines:\n\n  - “Bring your business tools into Xentri.”\n  - “One operating system for your whole business.”\n  - “From lead to invoice, in one flow.”\n\n  Homepage hero example:\n\n  > **Run your business in Xentri.**  \n  > Xentri OS connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots in a single workspace, so your team always works from the same source of truth.\n\n  Subheading example:\n\n  > No more switching apps or copying data by hand.  \n  > See every client, project, and invoice in one place, with automations you can trust and understand.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 8. Out of Scope (What Xentri Is Not)\n\n  - Not a generic task or note-taking app.\n  - Not a “growth hack” dashboard.\n  - Not just an integration layer that tapes together other tools.\n  - Not limited to one country or language; English-first, translation-ready.\n\n  Xentri is built as **infrastructure for small businesses and agencies**: multi-tenant, schema-based, event-driven.  \n  The brand should feel as solid and coherent as the architecture.\nbrainstorm_requested: true\nresearch_requested: true\nproduct_brief_requested: true\n"}}
