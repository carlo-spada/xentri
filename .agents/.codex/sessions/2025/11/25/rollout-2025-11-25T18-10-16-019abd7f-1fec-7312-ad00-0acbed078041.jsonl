Group related doc/code changes together.\n- PRs should include: summary of changes, linked issue/story, testing performed, and any schema/contract updates (call out `ts-schema` changes explicitly).\n- Add screenshots or sample payloads when touching UI or APIs. For migrations/events, include the migration file path and a brief rollback note.\n\n## Architecture Overview (Essentials)\n- The system is “Decoupled Unity”: Astro shell hosts lazy-loaded React micro-apps; backend services communicate through APIs and an event backbone (Postgres log → outbox to Redis Streams → n8n for orchestration).\n- Every table/event must be org-scoped; emit events instead of mutating history.

It uses a **Strategy Co-pilot** to generate a **Universal Brief** (the DNA of a business), which then powers a curated set of tools (Website, CRM, Invoicing) organized into 7 capability categories.\n\n**Status:** Early-stage development (v0.1 MVP: Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief). No source code exists yet—only documentation, architecture specs, and BMAD workflow definitions.\n\n## Architecture Philosophy: \"Decoupled Unity\"\n\nThe user sees one calm workspace; under the hood, each capability is an isolated module:\n\n| Layer | Technology | Role |\n|-------|------------|------|\n| **Shell** | Astro | Stable container (header + sidebar), handles routing and auth |\n| **Micro-Apps** | React Islands | Interactive SPAs lazy-loaded into the Shell |\n| **Backend** | Node.js (Docker) | Microservices per domain (core-api, sales-engine, finance-engine) |\n| **AI Service** | Python | Co-pilot Swarm host (Strategy, Brand, Sales, Finance agents) |\n| **Data** | Postgres | Single cluster, schema-per-service, RLS for multi-tenancy |\n| **Events** | Redis Streams → n8n | \"Nervous System\" for async event transport and workflow orchestration |\n\n**Non-negotiables:**\n- Multi-tenant from day zero: every table has `org_id` with Row-Level Security\n- Event-first: all business actions write to `system_events` before domain tables\n- Visible automation: every automated action logged with human-readable explanation\n- Services communicate via events, not direct calls\n\n## Planned Repository Structure (Turborepo Monorepo)\n\n```\n/xentri\n├── apps/\n│   └── shell/                # Astro Shell - mounts React micro-apps\n├── packages/\n│   ├── ui/                   # Shared Design System (Tailwind)\n│   ├── ts-schema/            # Shared Types & Zod Schemas (the \"Contract\")\n│   ├── cms-client/           # React CMS UI\n│   ├── crm-client/           # React CRM UI\n│   └── erp-client/           # React ERP UI\n├── services/\n│   ├── core-api/             # Users, Orgs, Billing, Event ingestion\n│   ├── brand-engine/         # Website, CMS\n│   ├── sales-engine/         # CRM, Quotes\n│   ├── finance-engine/       # Invoicing, Payments\n│   ├── ai-service/           # Python Co-pilot Swarm\n│   └── n8n-host/             # Self-hosted workflow automation\n├── docker-compose.yml\n└── turbo.json\n```\n\n## Development Commands (once scaffolded)\n\n```bash\nnpm install                # Install all workspace dependencies\ndocker-compose up -d       # Start Postgres, Redis, n8n, backend services\nnpm run dev                # Start Astro Shell + React watchers\n```\n\n## Key Technical Patterns\n\n### Event Backbone\n- All events stored in `system_events` table (append-only, immutable)\n- Events power: timelines, audit trails, Open Loops/Calm Prompt, cross-module intelligence\n- Corrections via compensating events, never edit history\n- Outbox pattern: Postgres → Redis Streams for cross-service transport\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n- Shell loads instantly (~15kb), sidebar/header persist across navigation\n- React SPAs lazy-loaded via `client:only=\"react\"` with hover prefetching\n- Cross-app state via Nano Stores, server state via TanStack Query\n- Error boundaries prevent \"white screen of death\"\n\n### AI Co-pilots\n- Swarm model: one `ai-service` hosts all co-pilots as configured runtimes\n- Stateless: spin up per request with system prompt + tools + model config\n- Scaffolding only: AI proposes, user confirms—no auto-publish\n- Each category has a specialized co-pilot that unlocks with first module subscription\n\n## BMAD Framework\n\nThis project uses BMAD for AI-assisted development workflows:\n\n| Directory | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| `.bmad/bmm/` | BMad Method - product development workflows |\n| `.bmad/bmb/` | BMad Builder - agent/workflow creation tools |\n| `.bmad/cis/` | Creative & Innovation Suite |\n| `.bmad/core/` | Core utilities and brainstorming |\n| `.claude/commands/` | Slash commands available via `/bmad:*` |\n\nKey workflows:\n- `/bmad:bmm:workflows:prd` - Create PRD from Product Brief\n- `/bmad:bmm:workflows:architecture` - Technical architecture decisions\n- `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-story` - Create user stories\n- `/bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story` - Implement stories\n\nWorkflow status tracked in `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`.\n\n## Key Documentation\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| `architecture.md` | Technical Constitution - data governance, service boundaries |\n| `docs/product-brief-*.md` | Complete product vision, personas, MVP scope |\n| `docs/architecture/event-model-v0.1.md` | Event Backbone schema and patterns |\n| `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` | Current workflow progress |\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **Clarity First** - Universal Brief before tools; AI generates structure, not just content\n2. **Calm UX** - One daily view of what matters; no notification flood\n3. **Visible, Not Magical** - Every automation logged with explanation\n4. **Modular Growth** - Start free, add $5 modules, grow to bundles\n5. **Works With Reality** - WhatsApp copy-paste flows, not rigid forms\n\n## Current Phase\n\n**v0.1 (Free tier):** Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief\n- Shell infrastructure with 7 category navigation\n- User auth (Supabase), multi-tenant architecture\n- Event Backbone v0.1 (Postgres `system_events`)\n- Brief generation via AI conversation\n\n**Next:** v0.2 (Presencia $10) - Website Builder + CMS + Lead Capture\n"}}

It is the \"Constitution\" for how we build, enabling us to add new modules (CMS, Marketing, HR) indefinitely without creating a monolith.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nThis platform is designed to be a **\"Modular Business OS,\"** automating disparate functions (Strategy, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Ops, Team, Legal) into a single, cohesive experience.\n\nUnlike traditional SaaS which suffers from \"tab fatigue\" (switching between different tools), this architecture uses a **Unified App Shell** to provide a seamless, native-app feel while maintaining strict technical isolation between services for scalability and team autonomy. The **Universal Brief** serves as the central source of truth, ensuring all modules and AI co-pilots share a unified understanding of the business.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Blueprint: \"Decoupled Unity\"\n\nWe strictly separate the **User Experience** from the **Business Logic**.\n\n| Layer | Metaphor | Role |\n|-------|----------|------|\n| **The Shell (Astro)** | The \"Body\" | A lightweight, server-rendered container that handles the frame, authentication, and routing. It creates the illusion of a Single Page Application (SPA). |\n| **The Organs (React Micro-Apps)** | The \"Capabilities\" | Interactive tools (Website, CRM, Invoicing) bundled as libraries and lazy-loaded into the Shell, organized by the 7 Capability Categories. |\n| **The Engine (Docker Microservices)** | The \"Muscle\" | Isolated backend containers that handle heavy processing, Node.js/Python logic, and database transactions. |\n| **The Nervous System (Events)** | The \"Signals\" | An event-driven layer that prevents services from talking directly to each other, ensuring the system remains modular. |\n\n### Visual Data Flow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    User[User Browser] -->|HTTPS| CDN[Edge Network / Vercel]\n    CDN -->|Serves| Shell[Astro App Shell]\n\n    subgraph \"Frontend (Browser)\"\n        Shell -->|Loads| Sidebar[Nano Store UI State]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| Brand[React Brand App]\n        Shell -->|Lazy Loads| Sales[React Sales App]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Backend (Docker Swarm / K8s)\"\n        Brand -->|API JSON| APIG[API Gateway]\n        Sales -->|API JSON| APIG\n\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/brand| Svc1[Brand Service Node]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/sales| Svc2[Sales Service Node]\n        APIG -->|Route: /api/ai| Svc3[AI Co-pilot Service Python]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"The Nervous System (Async)\"\n        Svc3 -->|Event: ChatFinished| Redis[Redis Streams]\n        Redis -->|Transport| N8N[n8n Workflow Engine]\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc1\n        N8N -->|Trigger| Svc2\n    end\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Repository Structure (Turborepo)\n\nWe use a **Monorepo** to share types and UI standards while enforcing strict isolation between business domains.\n\n```\n/business-os-monorepo\n├── /apps\n│   ├── /shell                # ASTRO.

The \"Nervous System\" (Event Architecture)\n\nTo ensure we can continuously plug in new modules (e.g., adding a \"Marketing Module\" next year without rewriting the CRM), we use a **two-layer event system**.\n\n### A. The Transport Layer: Redis Streams\n\n| Attribute | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Role** | High-volume, internal system synchronization. The \"Spinal Cord.\" |\n| **Use Case** | Data Integrity |\n| **Example** | User updates their avatar in the Shell → Redis Event → CRM Service updates its cache → ERP Service updates its cache. |\n| **Why** | It is immutable, blazing fast, and ensures services stay decoupled. |\n\n### B. The Logic Layer: n8n (Self-Hosted)\n\n| Attribute | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Role** | Business Logic Orchestration & Third-Party Integrations. The \"Brain.\" |\n| **Use Case** | Complex, malleable workflows. |\n| **Example** | \"When `lead_status` becomes `won`, generate a PDF contract, sign via DocuSign, and Slack the Sales Manager.\" |\n\n**Why n8n?**\n\n- **Visibility:** Analysts can visualize the business logic flow.\n- **Client Empowerment:** We can expose a restricted view to clients, allowing them to tweak their own automations (e.g., \"Change the alert email address\") without engineering involvement.\n\n### Event Flow Example\n\n```\n1. Bot Service finishes a conversation.\n2. Emits event: conversation.completed\n3. n8n catches event → Triggers \"Sentiment Analysis\" → Triggers \"Update CRM Record\"\n```\n\nThis allows us to add new automations **without touching the code of the core services**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Frontend Strategy: The \"Native PWA\" Feel\n\n**Objective:** Load instantly, transition seamlessly, never flash white.\n\n### A. The Technology Stack\n\n| Component | Technology |\n|-----------|------------|\n| **Host** | Astro (Server-Side Rendering + Client Router) |\n| **Micro-Apps** | React (bundled via Vite) |\n| **State** | Nano Stores (for cross-app UI signaling) |\n| **Data** | TanStack Query (for server-state synchronization) |\n\n### B. The Loading Strategy (Lazy Loading)\n\nWe do **not** bundle the ERP code with the CRM code.\n\n1. **Initial Load:** User downloads `shell.js` (~15kb). They see the Sidebar and Header immediately.\n2. **Interaction:** User hovers over \"CRM\".\n3. **Hydration:** Astro's router intercepts the hover. It fetches `chunk-crm.js` via `client:only=\"react\"` and mounts it hidden into the content area.\n4. **Interaction:** User clicks \"CRM\".\n5. **Hydration:** Astro's router intercepts the click. It mounts the hidden CRM app into the content area.\n6. **Transition:** The Sidebar persists. The content area transitions smoothly.\n\n### C. Routing\n\n- Routes like `/crm/*` are Astro pages that mount a specific React Island (`<CrmApp />`).\n- **Error Boundaries:** If the CRM bundle fails to load, the Shell catches the error. The Sidebar remains functional, preventing a \"White Screen of Death.\"\n\n### D. Communication (The \"Store\" Pattern)\n\nApps do **not** talk directly to each other. They talk to a shared Nano Store.\n\n**Example:** CRM updates \"Lead Status\". It calls `notifications.add()`. The Shell (listening to `notifications`) shows a toast.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Backend Strategy & Observability\n\n**Objective:** Isolation and independent scaling.\n\n### A. Containerization\n\nEach folder in `/services/*` has its own `Dockerfile`.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- **Isolation:** If the `ai-service` crashes due to a memory leak, the `finance-engine` keeps running perfectly.\n- **Scaling:** On Black Friday, we can spin up 50 replicas of `core-api` without paying for extra `ai-service` instances.\n\n### B. Observability\n\n| Concern | Strategy |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Logging** | Centralized (e.g., Loki/CloudWatch). No `console.log` into the void. |\n| **Tracing** | We tag every request with a `correlation_id` at the API Gateway. This ID follows the request from Frontend → API → Redis → n8n → Database, allowing us to trace a user action across the entire distributed system. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Data Strategy (Multi-Tenancy)\n\n**Objective:** Logical separation on a shared physical resource.\n\n### A. Database Topology\n"}}

One calm experience, fully event-first.\n- Deliverables (no fluff): updated `docs/architecture` note for the thread, initial `packages/ts-schema` contracts (`conversation.started`, `prompt.submitted`, `brief.drafted`), a minimal `/services/core-api` endpoint to ingest/store events, and an Astro shell route that mounts a React micro-app to run the chat and show the brief.\n- Why this is the only sane move: it exercises every pillar in miniature (multi-tenant, event-first, lazy-loaded UI, contract-driven types) without boiling the ocean.

Brand Core\n\n  ### 1.1 Problem From First Principles\n\n  - Small businesses and agencies run on **workflows**, not tools: lead → quote → project → invoice → payment → reporting.\n  - Today those workflows are split across **unrelated SaaS tools**, ad-hoc spreadsheets, and messaging apps (often WhatsApp).\n  - The real pain is not “missing features” but:\n    - **Fragmented state** (no single source of truth),\n    - **Manual glue work** (copy/paste, exports, screenshots),\n    - **Invisible automations** (things happen but nobody knows how or why).\n  - Owners care about **control and clarity** more than “AI magic.”\n  - Any solution that doesn’t respect **multi-tenant reality, accounting correctness, and permissions** will be rejected in practice.\n\n  ### 1.2 First-Principles Solution\n\n  From those fundamentals:\n\n  - Xentri is **not** “just another CRM or ERP.”\n  - Xentri is:\n    - A **unified shell**: one calm workspace instead of ten tabs.\n    - A **consistent data model**: clients, projects, invoices, and conversations all line up.\n    - An **event-driven backbone**: everything important (a deal closing, an invoice being paid, a bot sending a message) is an explicit event.\n    - A **visible automation layer**: workflows are inspectable, explainable, and correctable.\n    - An **AI operations brain**: the system can propose and trigger next actions across flows, based on the live state of the business.\n\n  > **Xentri is the operating system and AI brain for small businesses and agencies: one workspace, one data model, and one automation layer for the flows that actually run the business.**\n\n  ### 1.3 Refined One-Liner\n\n  > **Run your whole business with Xentri OS and Xentri’s AI operations brain – Xentri connects CRM, ERP, billing, and automations so your small or medium business can run day-to-day operations from a single workspace.**\n\n  ### 1.4 Refined Elevator Pitch\n\n  Most small businesses and agencies don’t suffer from a lack of tools; they suffer from tools that don’t agree with each other.\n\n  Leads live in one app, invoices in another, tasks in a third, and critical decisions happen in WhatsApp threads and owner memory.\n\n  Xentri starts from a different premise:\n\n  - The business has a **small number of critical flows** that must always work: from first contact to paid invoice (and beyond).\n  - Those flows deserve **one operating system and one AI brain**, not a chain of brittle integrations.\n\n  With Xentri:\n\n  - The team works in a **single shell** that feels like a native desktop app, not a pile of tabs.\n  - CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots are **modules** on a shared data model and event system.\n  - Every automation—whether it’s creating an invoice, updating a status, or sending a reminder—is **logged and explainable**.\n  - The AI layer acts as an **operations brain**: suggesting and orchestrating next actions so day-to-day work keeps flowing with less manual oversight.\n\n  Result: operators get calm, predictable control; owners get a trustworthy picture of the business; AI becomes infrastructure for daily operations, not a gimmick.\n\n  ### 1.5 Brand Promise\n\n  > **“Bring your business tools into Xentri, and run every critical flow from one place.”**\n\n  ### 1.6 Brand Pillars (Tightened)\n\n  1. **Unity of Workflows** – From lead to invoice, flows live in one system, on one schema.\n  2. **Calm Control** – No drama: clear states, predictable automations, stable UI.\n  3. **Visible Automation** – Every automated action is logged, explainable, and overridable.\n  4. **Operational Reality** – Built for multi-tenant ledgers, permissions, and real-world constraints from day one.\n  5. **Localization-Ready** – Copy, UX, and data model are designed to work across languages and markets.\n\n  ### 1.7 Key Personas (Empathy Map)\n\n  #### Persona 1 – Owner / Founder (S/MB or Agency Lead)\n\n  **Thinks**\n\n  - “Everything depends on me seeing the whole picture.”\n  - “We have the tools, but no single place to trust.”\n  - “If I step away, will things still move?”\n\n  **Feels**\n\n  - Proud of the business, but mentally overloaded.\n  - Anxious about dropped balls, missed invoices, and unread threads.\n  - Skeptical of “AI magic,” open to help that feels controllable.\n\n  **Sees**\n\n  - Staff hopping between CRM, spreadsheets, billing apps, WhatsApp.\n  - Different numbers for “revenue” in different tools.\n  - Automations that no one fully understands or owns.\n\n  **Says**\n\n  - “Why am I hearing about this problem so late?”\n  - “Can someone show me what’s really going on this week?”\n  - “I don’t want more tools. I want one place where I can see and steer.”\n\n  **Does**\n\n  - Checks multiple dashboards and chats to piece together reality.\n  - Manually nudges people to follow up or send invoices.\n  - Tries new tools, abandons them when they add complexity.\n\n  **Pains**\n\n  - No single source of truth.\n  - Fear of missing something critical (payments, client issues).\n  - High dependency on specific people’s memory and personal systems.\n\n  **Gains (with Xentri)**\n\n  - One calm workspace that shows the real state of the business at a glance.\n  - Xentri’s AI operations brain keeps the core flows (lead → quote → project → invoice → payment) moving automatically, and surfaces what needs their attention today.\n  - Confidence that things keep moving even when they are offline or travelling.\n\n  ---\n\n  #### Persona 2 – Operations / General Manager (“Integrator”)\n\n  **Thinks**\n\n  - “If the workflow is clear, the team can execute.”\n  - “Right now I’m the human router between tools and people.”\n  - “I need systems that scale beyond my personal spreadsheets.”\n\n  **Feels**\n\n  - Responsible for “how the business actually runs.”\n  - Frustrated by brittle integrations and hidden automations.\n  - Motivated by clean processes and visible ownership.\n\n  **Sees**\n\n  - Teams creating their own side-systems (Notion, sheets, private boards).\n  - Automation rules scattered across tools (Zapier, Make, native automations).\n  - Repeated bottlenecks at the same stages of the flow.\n\n  **Says**\n\n  - “Where does this data actually come from?”\n  - “Who owns this step in the process?”\n  - “If we change this, what else breaks?”\n\n  **Does**\n\n  - Builds and maintains integrations, templates, SOPs.\n  - Reconciles data between systems at end of week/month.\n  - Translates leadership priorities into tasks across tools.\n\n  **Pains**\n\n  - Being the single point of failure for process knowledge.\n  - Debugging invisible automations when something silently fails.\n  - Wasting time reconciling data instead of improving flows.\n\n  **Gains (with Xentri)**\n\n  - One OS where end-to-end flows are modeled explicitly and can be improved centrally instead of in ten tools.\n  - An automation log that shows what Xentri (AI + workflows) did, when, and why, so debugging is transparent.\n  - Xentri takes over the routine routing, updates and reconciliations, so ops can focus on designing and improving processes instead of being the human glue.\n\n  ---\n\n  #### Persona 3 – Client-Facing Lead (Account / Project Lead)\n\n  **Thinks**\n\n  - “My job is to keep clients happy and work moving.”\n  - “I spend too much time chasing information.”\n  - “I don’t care which tool, I care about not dropping the ball.”\n\n  **Feels**\n\n  - Stressed by context switching and fragmented information.\n  - Embarrassed when the team misses follow-ups or invoices.\n  - Relieved when there’s a clear, reliable system.\n\n  **Sees**\n\n  - Client info scattered: email in one place, invoices in another, tasks in a third.\n  - Different stakeholders giving different answers about status.\n  - Last-minute scrambles before client meetings.\n\n  **Says**\n\n  - “Where’s the latest on this client?”\n  - “Did we actually send that invoice?”\n  - “Can someone please unify this view?”\n\n  **Does**\n\n  - Rebuilds client timelines from email, chat, and tools.\n  - Creates personal checklists to compensate for system gaps.\n  - Pings ops/finance for status updates.\n\n  **Pains**\n\n  - Losing time to hunting and re-stating context.\n  - Feeling responsible for errors caused by the system, not them.\n  - Lack of trust in dashboards vs “asking around.”\n\n  **Gains (with Xentri)**\n\n  - One client view with conversations, deals, projects, invoices and automations in a single place.\n  - An AI assistant in Xentri that tells them “what’s next” for each client and each day, so follow-ups and invoicing don’t depend on their memory.\n  - Confidence that important steps won’t fall through the cracks, even when they’re context switching.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 2. Brand Personality\n\n  If Xentri were a person, it would be:\n\n  - **Analytical but human** – understands workflows and numbers, but speaks plainly.\n  - **Calm and composed** – no hype, no panic, just steady progress.\n  - **Quietly powerful** – does heavy lifting behind the scenes, without showing off.\n  - **Trustworthy and transparent** – automation is explainable, not magic.\n\n  Avoid personalities like:\n\n  - The loud “growth hacker” promising to 10x everything overnight.\n  - The jargon-heavy consultant who hides simple ideas behind complex language.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 3. Voice & Tone\n\n  ### 3.1 Principles\n\n  1. **Plain, clear English**  \n     - Write for busy operators and owners.\n     - Short sentences. Concrete nouns. Few buzzwords.\n\n  2. **Confident, not arrogant**  \n     - We know what we’re doing, but we don’t promise miracles.\n     - Say: “Xentri reduces errors and copy-paste work,” not “eliminates all problems forever.”\n\n  3. **Calm and reassuring**  \n     - Focus on stability, consistency, and clarity.\n     - Avoid fear tactics and fake urgency.\n\n  4. **Localization-friendly**  \n     - Use language that will translate cleanly later.\n     - Avoid idioms and jokes that only make sense in one culture.\n\n  ### 3.2 Writing Examples\n\n  **Good (homepage hero):**\n\n  > Run your business from one workspace.  \n  > Xentri connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots so your team always works in sync.\n\n  **Bad (too hype):**\n\n  > Smash chaos with our AI super-suite and 10x your growth in a week!\n\n  **Good (feature explanation):**\n\n  > When a deal is marked as won, Xentri can create the project, schedule tasks, and issue the invoice.  \n  > You can see every step in the automation log.\n\n  **Bad (too vague / magical):**\n\n  > Our AI takes care of everything behind the scenes. Just sit back and relax.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 4. Visual Identity (v0.1)\n\n  These are starting points for design; they will evolve with real UI work.\n\n  ### 4.1 Color Direction\n\n  Concept: **Orchestrated calm.**\n\n  - **Base:** Deep neutral (charcoal / ink) for backgrounds or major chrome.\n  - **Primary accent:** A modern blue or teal that suggests clarity and flow.\n  - **Secondary accents:** Soft gradients or subtle secondary colors for CRM vs ERP vs Bots.\n\n  Usage:\n\n  - Use color to signal **state** (success, warning, error) and **hierarchy**, not decoration.\n  - Each core module can lean on a slightly different accent shade while keeping the overall look cohesive.\n\n  ### 4.2 Typography\n\n  Goals:\n\n  - Highly legible for tables, metrics, and forms.\n  - Works across many locales and screen sizes.\n\n  Suggestions:\n\n  - **Headings:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar).\n  - **Body text:** Same family, regular weight, 14–16px for readability.\n\n  Rules:\n\n  - Keep titles short and scannable.\n  - Avoid over-styling; let whitespace and hierarchy do most of the work.\n\n  ### 4.3 Iconography & Illustration\n\n  - Icons should be simple and consistent, ideally line-based or minimal solid icons.\n  - Avoid cartoon mascots and over-cute elements.\n  - If using illustrations, prefer abstract representations of flows, nodes, or grids rather than generic “businesspeople with laptops.”\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 5. Product UX Principles\n\n  1. **One Shell, Many Apps**  \n     - The sidebar and header are stable anchors across CRM, ERP, Billing, and Bots.\n     - Switching between modules should feel like changing panels, not switching websites.\n\n  2. **Keep Context With the User**  \n     - From any client record, you should be able to see related deals, invoices, tasks, and automations without opening five tabs.\n\n  3. **Explain Automations**  \n     - Every automated action (sending an invoice, updating a status, posting a message) should be visible and traceable.\n     - Provide an “automation log” or similar view.\n\n  4. **Multi-Tenant Safety by Design**  \n     - Make organization boundaries obvious.\n     - Never make it easy to confuse data between orgs or clients.\n\n  5. **Design for Everyday Use, Not Demos**  \n     - Optimize for the daily workflows of small agencies and businesses:\n       - Lead → quote → project → invoice → payment.\n     - Fancy dashboards are secondary to clean, efficient flows.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 6. Naming System (Modules & Sub-Brands)\n\n  Assuming **Xentri** as master brand:\n\n  - **Platform:** Xentri OS\n  - **Modules:**\n    - **Xentri CRM** – Leads, pipelines, activities, deals.\n    - **Xentri ERP** – Invoices, ledgers, inventory, suppliers.\n    - **Xentri Billing** – Subscriptions, one-off invoices, payment status.\n    - **Xentri Bots** – AI assistants, chatbots, workflow automations.\n    - **Xentri Core** – Auth, organizations, users, plans, multi-tenancy.\n\n  Guidelines:\n\n  - Use full module names in documentation and marketing.\n  - Inside the app, you can shorten to **CRM**, **ERP**, **Billing**, **Bots**, **Core** once users are oriented.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 7. Example Taglines & Messaging\n\n  Short taglines:\n\n  - “Bring your business tools into Xentri.”\n  - “One operating system for your whole business.”\n  - “From lead to invoice, in one flow.”\n\n  Homepage hero example:\n\n  > **Run your business in Xentri.**  \n  > Xentri OS connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots in a single workspace, so your team always works from the same source of truth.\n\n  Subheading example:\n\n  > No more switching apps or copying data by hand.  \n  > See every client, project, and invoice in one place, with automations you can trust and understand.\n\n  ---\n\n  ## 8. Out of Scope (What Xentri Is Not)\n\n  - Not a generic task or note-taking app.\n  - Not a “growth hack” dashboard.\n  - Not just an integration layer that tapes together other tools.\n  - Not limited to one country or language; English-first, translation-ready.\n\n  Xentri is built as **infrastructure for small businesses and agencies**: multi-tenant, schema-based, event-driven.  \n  The brand should feel as solid and coherent as the architecture.\nbrainstorm_requested: true\nresearch_requested: true\nproduct_brief_requested: true\n"}}

Scope Management\n\n### MVP Discipline\n\n- [ ] MVP scope is genuinely minimal and viable\n- [ ] Core features list contains only true must-haves\n- [ ] Each MVP feature has clear rationale for inclusion\n- [ ] No obvious scope creep in \"must-have\" list\n\n### Future Work Captured\n\n- [ ] Growth features documented for post-MVP\n- [ ] Vision features captured to maintain long-term direction\n- [ ] Out-of-scope items explicitly listed\n- [ ] Deferred features have clear reasoning for deferral\n\n### Clear Boundaries\n\n- [ ] Stories marked as MVP vs Growth vs Vision\n- [ ] Epic sequencing aligns with MVP → Growth progression\n- [ ] No confusion about what's in vs out of initial scope\n\n---\n\n## 7. Research and Context Integration\n\n### Source Document Integration\n\n- [ ] **If product brief exists:** Key insights incorporated into PRD\n- [ ] **If domain brief exists:** Domain requirements reflected in FRs and stories\n- [ ] **If research documents exist:** Research findings inform requirements\n- [ ] **If competitive analysis exists:** Differentiation strategy clear in PRD\n- [ ] All source documents referenced in PRD References section\n\n### Research Continuity to Architecture\n\n- [ ] Domain complexity considerations documented for architects\n- [ ] Technical constraints from research captured\n- [ ] Regulatory/compliance requirements clearly stated\n- [ ] Integration requirements with existing systems documented\n- [ ] Performance/scale requirements informed by research data\n\n### Information Completeness for Next Phase\n\n- [ ] PRD provides sufficient context for architecture decisions\n- [ ] Epics provide sufficient detail for technical design\n- [ ] Stories have enough acceptance criteria for implementation\n- [ ] Non-obvious business rules documented\n- [ ] Edge cases and special scenarios captured\n\n---\n\n## 8. Cross-Document Consistency\n\n### Terminology Consistency\n\n- [ ] Same terms used across PRD and epics for concepts\n- [ ] Feature names consistent between documents\n- [ ] Epic titles match between PRD and epics.md\n- [ ] No contradictions between PRD and epics\n\n### Alignment Checks\n\n- [ ] Success metrics in PRD align with story outcomes\n- [ ] Product differentiator articulated in PRD reflected in epic goals\n- [ ] Technical preferences in PRD align with story implementation hints\n- [ ] Scope boundaries consistent across all documents\n\n---\n\n## 9.

Ideas live in notes apps, client info in WhatsApp, invoices in spreadsheets, and critical context in the owner's head.\n\n**Xentri's approach:**\n1. Start free with the **Strategy Co-pilot**—an AI that helps you think through your business, not just produce content\n2. Generate a **Universal Brief**—the living DNA of your business that powers everything else\n3. Unlock **personalized module bundles** based on your Brief, not a one-size-fits-all feature catalog\n4. Grow the operational backbone underneath you—one module at a time—without a big-bang migration\n\n**This PRD covers v0.1-v0.2 (MVP):**\n- **v0.1 (Free):** Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief\n- **v0.2 (Presencia, $10/mo):** Website Builder + CMS + Lead Capture\n\nTogether, these create the first complete value loop: **Idea → Brief → Website → Leads**.\n\n**The architecture is non-trivial.** Getting the foundation right (Event Backbone, Brief schema, orchestration layer) is the gate to everything else. We are building load-bearing infrastructure, not just features.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\n**The differentiator is not \"AI\" or \"all-in-one.\"** Every competitor is adding AI. Every competitor claims to be all-in-one.\n\n**Xentri's differentiation:**\n- We use AI to generate **clarity and structure**, not just content\n- We start with a **free entry point** that delivers real value before asking for money\n- We offer **personalized bundles** based on who you are, not fixed tiers for everyone\n- We surface **one calm view** of what matters today, not a flood of notifications\n\n> **The emotional job Xentri solves:** Turn chronic, background anxiety into a manageable, visible list of responsibilities—so founders and owners feel caught up instead of constantly behind.\n\n### The Core Value: Orchestration, Not Modules\n\n**Any individual module can be \"good enough\" elsewhere.** Wix builds websites. Jobber manages jobs. Jane handles appointments. Each does their thing adequately.\n\n**What doesn't exist is the orchestration.**\n\nThe real value of Xentri is not that it has a CRM, or a website builder, or invoicing. It's that:\n- The **Universal Brief** informs everything—your website pulls from it, your CRM structures around it, your co-pilots reference it\n- The **Event Backbone** connects everything—`lead_created` triggers follow-up logic, `quote_accepted` can auto-generate invoice, every action is traceable\n- The **Shell** unifies everything—one workspace, one navigation, one \"what needs attention\" view across all capabilities\n\n**Xentri is the connective tissue.** The modules are table stakes; the integration is the moat.\n\n### Validation Model: Client Zero\n\nUntil v1.0, **Xentri is its own primary customer.**\n\n- Xentri's public website is built with Xentri Website Builder\n- Xentri's content is managed by Xentri CMS\n- Xentri's leads are captured by Xentri Lead Capture\n- Xentri's goals are tracked in Xentri Strategy module\n\nExternal customers before v1.0 are a bonus, not a success criterion. The validation question is: **\"Can Xentri run Xentri?\"** If yes, it can run any business.\n\nThis is not dogfooding as QA. This is existence proof as strategy.\n\n---\n\n## Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** SaaS B2B + Web App (PWA)\n**Domain:** General Business Software\n**Complexity:** Medium\n\n### Classification Details\n\n**Project Type Signals Detected:**\n- Multi-tenant architecture from day one\n- Subscription-based pricing model with tiered bundles\n- Dashboard-centric experience with modular capabilities\n- Progressive Web App targeting browser + mobile\n- AI co-pilot as core differentiator (not bolt-on)\n\n**Domain Classification:**\n- Standard business operations software (CRM, website, lead capture)\n- No specialized regulatory domain (healthcare, fintech, govtech)\n- Locale-specific compliance (CFDI/SII) deferred to v0.4+\n- General software best practices apply\n\n**Complexity Rationale:**\n\n| Dimension | Level | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|-------|\n| Regulatory | Low | No external approval gates; standard web security/privacy |\n| Architectural | Medium-High | Event Backbone as source of truth; Universal Brief as \"DNA\" powering all modules; multi-tenant from day zero |\n| Feature | Low-Medium | Standard SaaS patterns (forms, CMS, lead capture) built on sophisticated foundation |\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nThe foundational architecture (Event Backbone, Brief schema, multi-tenancy) requires careful design—these are load-bearing walls. However, the feature-level complexity is standard. Getting the foundation right enables rapid feature development later; getting it wrong creates compounding technical debt.\n\n### Primary Competitive Threat\n\n**Wix/Squarespace—not vertical SaaS—is the primary threat.**\n\n| Competitor Type | Threat Level | Why |\n|-----------------|--------------|-----|\n| **Wix/Squarespace** | High | Same entry point (\"I need a website\"). Massive reach. Adding CRM/invoicing features. If they add a \"business clarity\" AI, they have distribution we don't. |\n| **Vertical SaaS** (Jobber, Jane) | Medium | Different entry point (\"I need job software\"). Users who find them already know what they need. We capture earlier in the journey. |\n| **All-in-one platforms** (GoHighLevel, Odoo) | Low-Medium | Overwhelming complexity. We win on \"calm.\" They assume expert admins; we assume busy founders. |\n\n**Strategic implication:** Xentri must differentiate on *orchestration and operational brain*, not just \"pretty website.\" Wix can match pretty. Wix can't match \"your Brief powers your CRM powers your invoicing.\"\n\n---\n\n## Readiness Criteria\n\n**These are technical quality gates, not customer validation targets.**\n\nExternal customers before v1.0 are not the success metric. The question is: **\"Is the system ready to run a real business (starting with Xentri itself)?\"**\n\n### v0.1 Readiness (Strategy Co-pilot + Brief)\n\n| Criterion | Gate | How We Know |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| **Brief completion works** | Pass/Fail | A user can go from sign-up to completed Brief in <15 minutes via conversation |\n| **Co-pilot conversation quality** | Qualitative | Conversation feels natural, not robotic. Follow-ups are relevant. Fallback to guided form works gracefully. |\n| **Brief schema is stable** | Pass/Fail | Schema supports all 7 sections (Identity, Audience, Offerings, Positioning, Operations, Goals, Proof). Versioning strategy defined. |\n| **Event Backbone logs reliably** | Pass/Fail | `brief_created`, `brief_updated` events fire correctly. Events are queryable. |\n| **Multi-tenancy is airtight** | Pass/Fail | Every query includes `org_id`. RLS enforced. No data leaks in testing. |\n| **Shell loads fast** | <2s on 3G | First meaningful paint under 2 seconds. |\n\n### v0.2 Readiness (Presencia: Website + CMS + Leads)\n\n| Criterion | Gate | How We Know |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| **Website publishes from Brief** | Pass/Fail | A user can generate a live website that pulls business name, services, positioning from their Brief |\n| **Custom domain works** | Pass/Fail | User can connect their own domain. SSL provisioned automatically. |\n| **Lead capture fires events** | Pass/Fail | `lead_created` event logged. Notification delivered (email + in-app). |\n| **CMS content is editable** | Pass/Fail | User can create/edit blog posts, service pages, portfolio items. |\n| **Brief → Website flow is seamless** | Qualitative | Content auto-populated from Brief feels right, not robotic. User can override. |\n| **Xentri runs on Xentri** | Pass/Fail | Xentri's own public site, content, and lead capture are powered by v0.2. |\n\n### Orchestration Readiness (Cross-Cutting)\n\n| Criterion | Gate | How We Know |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| **Events flow across modules** | Pass/Fail | `brief_updated` can trigger website content refresh prompt. `lead_created` appears in unified timeline. |\n| **Brief is live source of truth** | Pass/Fail | Changing Brief updates downstream consumers (website pulls new business name). |\n| **Shell navigation is stable** | Pass/Fail | Switching between Strategy and Brand categories feels like changing panels, not loading new apps. |\n\n---\n\n## Key Risks\n\n### Critical Risks (Must Mitigate)\n\n| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |\n|------|----------|------------|\n| **AI quality dependency** | Critical | The entire \"clarity-first\" differentiation depends on the Strategy Co-pilot being *good*. If conversations feel clunky or outputs are generic, positioning collapses. **Mitigation:** Graceful fallback to guided forms. Constrained scope (produce Brief, not run the business). Logged proposals for iteration. Quality benchmarks before launch. |\n| **Architectural foundation failure** | Critical | Event Backbone and Brief schema are load-bearing. Getting them wrong creates compounding debt. **Mitigation:** Foundation is a gated milestone. No feature work until Event Backbone is proven. Schema versioning strategy defined upfront. |\n| **Multi-tenant data leak** | Critical | One leak = catastrophic trust loss. **Mitigation:** RLS enforced in Postgres. Every query includes `org_id`. Paranoid testing. Code review checklist. |\n\n### High Risks (Active Monitoring)\n\n| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |\n|------|----------|------------|\n| **Wix/Squarespace adds clarity AI** | High | If incumbents copy \"conversation-first onboarding,\" we lose differentiation. **Mitigation:** Orchestration is the moat, not the entry point. Brief → everything is hard to replicate. Move fast. |\n| **Co-pilot hallucination** | High | AI generates plausible but wrong content. **Mitigation:** Scaffolding only—AI proposes, user confirms. No auto-publish. All proposals logged. |\n| **Scope creep on Website Builder** | Medium-High | Website builders are infinite scope sinks. **Mitigation:** Evaluate GrapesJS/Craft.js instead of building from scratch. Launch with 3-4 quality templates, not infinite customization. |\n\n### Accepted Risks (Proceed Anyway)\n\n| Risk | Severity | Rationale |\n|------|----------|-----------|\n| **No external customers until v1.0** | Accepted | Client Zero validation is sufficient. External customers are bonus. |\n| **PWA instead of native mobile** | Accepted | PWA is sufficient for MVP. Native can come later if needed. |\n| **No CFDI/SII compliance** | Accepted | Deferred to v0.4+. English-speaking markets first. |\n\n---\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product (v0.1-v0.2)\n\n**The first complete value loop: Idea → Brief → Website → Leads**\n\nMVP is not \"feature complete.\" MVP is \"orchestration proven.\" The question isn't \"does each module work?\" but \"does the Brief power the Website power the Lead Capture, with events flowing through?\"\n\n#### v0.1: Foundation + Strategy (Free Tier)\n\n**Category: Management & Strategy**\n\n| Component | What It Does | Orchestration Role |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Strategy Co-pilot** | Conversational onboarding that produces the Universal Brief | Entry point; creates the DNA that powers everything |\n| **Universal Brief** | Living document with 7 sections: Identity, Audience, Offerings, Positioning, Operations, Goals, Proof | Source of truth consumed by all downstream modules |\n| **Shell Infrastructure** | Astro shell with header + collapsible sidebar, 7 category navigation | Unified workspace; modules feel like panels, not apps |\n| **Event Backbone v0.1** | Postgres `system_events` table; `brief_created`, `brief_updated` events | Audit trail; foundation for cross-module intelligence |\n| **Multi-tenant Core** | Every table has `org_id`; RLS enforced | Security foundation; non-negotiable from day zero |\n| **Auth** | Supabase Auth or similar | User management; organization creation |\n\n**v0.1 proves:** The conversation-to-Brief flow works. Events log reliably. Multi-tenancy is airtight.\n\n#### v0.2: Presencia (Website + CMS + Leads) — $10/mo, 3 modules\n\n**Category: Brand & Marketing**\n\n| Module | What It Does | Orchestration Role |\n|--------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Website Builder** | Drag-and-drop page builder with responsive templates | Consumes Brief (business name, services, positioning auto-populate) |\n| **CMS / Portfolio** | Blog, service pages, photo galleries | Content layer; feeds Website Builder |\n| **Lead Capture** | Contact form, lead notification, basic lead list | First external data entering the system; fires `lead_created` events |\n| **Brand Co-pilot** | AI specialized for Brand & Marketing tasks | Reads Brief for context; suggests copy, reviews content |\n\n**v0.2 proves:** Brief → Website flow is seamless. Events flow across modules (`lead_created` appears in timeline). Xentri can run Xentri.\n\n#### What's Explicitly NOT in MVP\n\n| Feature | Why Deferred |\n|---------|--------------|\n| CRM / Client Management | v0.3 (Sales category) |\n| Quotes / Pipeline | v0.3 (Sales category) |\n| Invoicing / Payments | v0.4 (Finance category) |\n| Multi-user / Roles | v0.4 (Business in Motion tier) |\n| WhatsApp Bridge | v0.3 (strategic, but requires Sales context) |\n| Custom automations | Post-MVP (Open Loops view in v0.4 is the first step) |\n\n---\n\n### Growth Features (v0.3-v0.4)\n\n**The full operational backbone: Leads → Quotes → Invoices → Payments**\n\nThese releases extend orchestration into revenue-generating workflows. Still focused on Client Zero validation.\n\n#### v0.3: Light Ops (Sales & Pipeline) — $30/mo, 8 modules\n\n| Module | Orchestration Role |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **Client Management** | Clients linked to leads, quotes, invoices; unified timeline |\n| **Quote Builder** | Pulls from Brief (services, pricing); fires `quote_created`, `quote_sent` |\n| **Pipeline View** | Visual funnel; `deal_stage_changed` events |\n| **Follow-up System** | Scheduled reminders; `followup_scheduled`, `followup_completed` events |\n| **WhatsApp Bridge** | \"Magic Copy\" flow; bridges where users live to structured data |\n| **Sales Co-pilot** | Reads client history, suggests follow-ups, analyzes pipeline |\n\n**v0.3 proves:** The CRM layer integrates with Brief and Website. Quote creation pulls from Brief. Events chain across Lead → Client → Quote.\n\n#### v0.4: Business in Motion (Finance & Accounting) — $90/mo, ~24 modules\n\n| Module | Orchestration Role |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **Invoicing** | Can auto-generate from accepted quotes; `invoice_issued` events |\n| **Payment Tracking** | Marks invoices paid; `payment_received` events |\n| **Open Loops View** | Daily \"what needs attention\" across all categories—the Calm Prompt |\n| **Tax Pack Export** | Clean CSV/Excel for accountants; data portability |\n| **Finance Co-pilot** | Analyzes revenue, flags overdue, suggests pricing |\n| **Multi-User Access** | Invite team members; category-specific access; role assignments |\n\n**v0.4 proves:** Full revenue loop works (Lead → Quote → Invoice → Payment). Open Loops view surfaces what matters. Multi-user doesn't break multi-tenancy.\n\n---\n\n### Vision Features (v0.5+)\n\n**The full Business OS: Every category, every co-pilot, complete orchestration**\n\n| Phase | Category | Key Capabilities |\n|-------|----------|------------------|\n| v0.5-v0.6 | Operations & Delivery | Jobs, Projects, Scheduling, Dispatching |\n| v0.5-v0.6 | Team & Leadership | Roles, SOPs, Knowledge Base, Onboarding |\n| v0.5+ | Secondary Geo | CFDI (Mexico), SII (Spain) compliance |\n| v0.5+ | Payments | Stripe, MercadoPago integration |\n| v0.7+ | Legal & Compliance | Contracts, Licenses, Policies |\n| v0.7+ | WhatsApp Full API | Beyond Magic Copy; automated responses |\n| v1.0+ | External Customers | Go-to-market beyond Client Zero |\n| v1.0+ | Advanced | Voice-to-Intent, AI pricing suggestions, cross-business intelligence |\n\n**Vision success:** Any business type can run their complete operation in Xentri—from first idea to recurring revenue—with one Brief, one Event Backbone, one calm workspace.\n\n---\n\n## SaaS B2B Specific Requirements\n\n### Multi-Tenancy Model\n\n**Architecture:** Single-schema with `org_id` column + Row-Level Security (RLS).\n\n| Requirement | Specification |\n|-------------|---------------|\n| **Tenant isolation** | Every table includes `org_id` column. Row-Level Security (RLS) enforced at database level. |\n| **Tenant creation** | New organization created on sign-up. User becomes Owner of that org. |\n| **Data boundaries** | No query can return data across orgs. Even admin tools operate within org context. |\n| **Tenant deletion** | Soft delete with 30-day recovery window. Hard delete purges all org data. |\n\n**Critical constraint:** Multi-tenancy is not a feature—it's a security property. Any RLS bypass is a critical bug.\n\n### Permission Model (RBAC)\n\n**MVP (v0.1-v0.2):** Single-user only. One Owner per org.\n\n**v0.4+ (Multi-user):**\n\n| Role | Access | Use Case |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| **Owner** | Full access to all categories and settings | Business founder/owner |\n| **Admin** | Full access to assigned categories; can invite Members | Operations manager, spouse/admin |\n| **Member** | Access to specific modules within assigned categories | Accountant (Finance only), marketer (Brand only) |\n\n**Permission boundaries:**\n- Roles are category-scoped, not module-scoped (simpler mental model)\n- Owner can assign categories to Admins/Members\n- No cross-org access under any circumstances\n\n### Subscription Tiers\n\n| Tier | Price | Modules | Target User |\n|------|-------|---------|-------------|\n| **Free** | $0/mo | 1 (Strategy Co-pilot + Brief) | Anyone starting out |\n| **Presencia** | $10/mo | 3 (personalized bundle) | Founders, solo practitioners needing web presence |\n| **Light Ops** | $30/mo | 8 (personalized bundle) | Owners running daily operations |\n| **Business in Motion** | $90/mo | ~24 + multi-user | Growing teams needing full revenue loop |\n| **Professional** | $270/mo | ~72 + advanced | Scaled teams with specialists per category |\n| **Enterprise** | $500+/mo | 135+ + custom | Large organizations with dedicated support |\n\n**Tier mechanics:**\n- Bundles are personalized based on Universal Brief (a plumber's $10 ≠ a founder's $10)\n- À la carte: Any module can be added individually at $5/mo\n- Upgrade/downgrade: Prorated, effective immediately\n- Bundle savings: ~25-33% vs à la carte equivalent\n\n### Integration Requirements (MVP Scope)\n\n**v0.1-v0.2 integrations:**\n\n| Integration | Type | Purpose |\n|-------------|------|---------|\n| **Supabase Auth** | Core | User authentication, session management |\n| **Transactional Email** (Resend/Postmark) | Core | Lead notifications, password reset, system emails |\n| **DNS Provider API** | v0.2 | Custom domain connection for websites |\n| **SSL Provider** (Let's Encrypt) | v0.2 | Automatic SSL for custom domains |\n\n**Deferred integrations:**\n- Payment gateway (Stripe) → v0.4+\n- WhatsApp Business API → v0.3+ (Magic Copy is copy/paste, not API)\n- Calendar sync → v0.5+\n- Accounting export (QuickBooks, Xero) → v0.5+\n\n### Compliance Requirements (MVP Scope)\n\n| Requirement | Scope | Implementation |\n|-------------|-------|----------------|\n| **GDPR basics** | MVP | Data export on request; deletion on request; privacy policy |\n| **Cookie consent** | MVP | Consent banner for analytics (if any) |\n| **Terms of Service** | MVP | Standard SaaS ToS |\n| **Data retention** | MVP | Event logs retained indefinitely; user data per org policy |\n| **CFDI (Mexico)** | v0.4+ | Electronic invoicing via SAT-authorized PAC |\n| **SII (Spain)** | v0.4+ | Real-time invoice reporting |\n\n**Compliance stance:** MVP targets English-speaking markets with standard SaaS compliance. Locale-specific invoicing compliance is a Phase 2 expansion concern.\n\n---\n\n## User Experience Requirements\n\n**Philosophy:** Light touch. Define the feel, not the pixels. Detailed interactions belong in the UX Design phase.\n\n### Core UX Principles\n\n| Principle | Requirement |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Calm, not noisy** | Maximum 3-5 items in any \"attention needed\" view. No notification floods. |\n| **One shell, many panels** | Switching categories/modules feels like changing tabs, not loading new apps. Target: <500ms transition. |\n| **Brief as context** | Any module that can use Brief data should auto-populate from it. User can override. |\n| **Visible automation** | Every automated action shows what happened and why. \"Xentri did X because Y.\" |\n| **Mobile-responsive** | All interfaces must work on mobile viewport. Not mobile-first, but mobile-capable. |\n| **Accessibility baseline** | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for core flows (sign-up, Brief creation, website editing). |\n\n### Key Interaction Requirements\n\n| Interaction | Requirement |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| **Onboarding** | Conversation-first (Co-pilot), not form-first. Fallback to guided form if AI fails. |\n| **Navigation** | Sidebar shows 7 categories. Only subscribed categories are active. One category expanded at a time. |\n| **Module switching** | Tab-based within category SPA. No full page reload. |\n| **Data entry** | Prefer progressive disclosure over long forms. Ask for minimum, expand as needed. |\n| **Feedback** | All actions confirm success/failure. No silent failures. |\n| **Dark mode** | Supported from v0.1. User preference stored. |\n\n---\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n**This section is the capability contract for all downstream work.**\n\n- UX designers will design what's listed here\n- Architects will support what's listed here\n- Epic breakdown will implement what's listed here\n- If a capability is missing from FRs, it will NOT exist in the final product\n\n### FR Organization\n\nFRs are organized by **capability area** (what users/system can do), not by technology layer.\n\nScope: **v0.1-v0.2 only** (MVP).

Ideas live in notes apps, client info in WhatsApp, invoices in spreadsheets, and critical context in the owner's head.\n    14\t\n    15\t**Xentri's approach:**\n    16\t1. Start free with the **Strategy Co-pilot**—an AI that helps you think through your business, not just produce content\n    17\t2. Generate a **Universal Brief**—the living DNA of your business that powers everything else\n    18\t3. Unlock **personalized module bundles** based on your Brief, not a one-size-fits-all feature catalog\n    19\t4. Grow the operational backbone underneath you—one module at a time—without a big-bang migration\n    20\t\n    21\t**This PRD covers v0.1-v0.2 (MVP):**\n    22\t- **v0.1 (Free):** Strategy Co-pilot + Universal Brief\n    23\t- **v0.2 (Presencia, $10/mo):** Website Builder + CMS + Lead Capture\n    24\t\n    25\tTogether, these create the first complete value loop: **Idea → Brief → Website → Leads**.\n    26\t\n    27\t**The architecture is non-trivial.** Getting the foundation right (Event Backbone, Brief schema, orchestration layer) is the gate to everything else. We are building load-bearing infrastructure, not just features.\n    28\t\n    29\t### What Makes This Special\n    30\t\n    31\t**The differentiator is not \"AI\" or \"all-in-one.\"** Every competitor is adding AI. Every competitor claims to be all-in-one.\n    32\t\n    33\t**Xentri's differentiation:**\n    34\t- We use AI to generate **clarity and structure**, not just content\n    35\t- We start with a **free entry point** that delivers real value before asking for money\n    36\t- We offer **personalized bundles** based on who you are, not fixed tiers for everyone\n    37\t- We surface **one calm view** of what matters today, not a flood of notifications\n    38\t\n    39\t> **The emotional job Xentri solves:** Turn chronic, background anxiety into a manageable, visible list of responsibilities—so founders and owners feel caught up instead of constantly behind.\n    40\t\n    41\t### The Core Value: Orchestration, Not Modules\n    42\t\n    43\t**Any individual module can be \"good enough\" elsewhere.** Wix builds websites. Jobber manages jobs. Jane handles appointments. Each does their thing adequately.\n    44\t\n    45\t**What doesn't exist is the orchestration.**\n    46\t\n    47\tThe real value of Xentri is not that it has a CRM, or a website builder, or invoicing. It's that:\n    48\t- The **Universal Brief** informs everything—your website pulls from it, your CRM structures around it, your co-pilots reference it\n    49\t- The **Event Backbone** connects everything—`lead_created` triggers follow-up logic, `quote_accepted` can auto-generate invoice, every action is traceable\n    50\t- The **Shell** unifies everything—one workspace, one navigation, one \"what needs attention\" view across all capabilities\n    51\t\n    52\t**Xentri is the connective tissue.** The modules are table stakes; the integration is the moat.\n    53\t\n    54\t### Validation Model: Client Zero\n    55\t\n    56\tUntil v1.0, **Xentri is its own primary customer.**\n    57\t\n    58\t- Xentri's public website is built with Xentri Website Builder\n    59\t- Xentri's content is managed by Xentri CMS\n    60\t- Xentri's leads are captured by Xentri Lead Capture\n    61\t- Xentri's goals are tracked in Xentri Strategy module\n    62\t\n    63\tExternal customers before v1.0 are a bonus, not a success criterion. The validation question is: **\"Can Xentri run Xentri?\"** If yes, it can run any business.\n    64\t\n    65\tThis is not dogfooding as QA. This is existence proof as strategy.\n    66\t\n    67\t---\n    68\t\n    69\t## Project Classification\n    70\t\n    71\t**Technical Type:** SaaS B2B + Web App (PWA)\n    72\t**Domain:** General Business Software\n    73\t**Complexity:** Medium\n    74\t\n    75\t### Classification Details\n    76\t\n    77\t**Project Type Signals Detected:**\n    78\t- Multi-tenant architecture from day one\n    79\t- Subscription-based pricing model with tiered bundles\n    80\t- Dashboard-centric experience with modular capabilities\n    81\t- Progressive Web App targeting browser + mobile\n    82\t- AI co-pilot as core differentiator (not bolt-on)\n    83\t\n    84\t**Domain Classification:**\n    85\t- Standard business operations software (CRM, website, lead capture)\n    86\t- No specialized regulatory domain (healthcare, fintech, govtech)\n    87\t- Locale-specific compliance (CFDI/SII) deferred to v0.4+\n    88\t- General software best practices apply\n    89\t\n    90\t**Complexity Rationale:**\n    91\t\n    92\t| Dimension | Level | Notes |\n    93\t|-----------|-------|-------|\n    94\t| Regulatory | Low | No external approval gates; standard web security/privacy |\n    95\t| Architectural | Medium-High | Event Backbone as source of truth; Universal Brief as \"DNA\" powering all modules; multi-tenant from day zero |\n    96\t| Feature | Low-Medium | Standard SaaS patterns (forms, CMS, lead capture) built on sophisticated foundation |\n    97\t\n    98\t**Why This Matters:**\n    99\tThe foundational architecture (Event Backbone, Brief schema, multi-tenancy) requires careful design—these are load-bearing walls. However, the feature-level complexity is standard. Getting the foundation right enables rapid feature development later; getting it wrong creates compounding technical debt.\n   100\t\n   101\t### Primary Competitive Threat\n   102\t\n   103\t**Wix/Squarespace—not vertical SaaS—is the primary threat.**\n   104\t\n   105\t| Competitor Type | Threat Level | Why |\n   106\t|-----------------|--------------|-----|\n   107\t| **Wix/Squarespace** | High | Same entry point (\"I need a website\"). Massive reach. Adding CRM/invoicing features. If they add a \"business clarity\" AI, they have distribution we don't. |\n   108\t| **Vertical SaaS** (Jobber, Jane) | Medium | Different entry point (\"I need job software\"). Users who find them already know what they need. We capture earlier in the journey. |\n   109\t| **All-in-one platforms** (GoHighLevel, Odoo) | Low-Medium | Overwhelming complexity. We win on \"calm.\" They assume expert admins; we assume busy founders. |\n   110\t\n   111\t**Strategic implication:** Xentri must differentiate on *orchestration and operational brain*, not just \"pretty website.\" Wix can match pretty. Wix can't match \"your Brief powers your CRM powers your invoicing.\"\n   112\t\n   113\t---\n   114\t\n   115\t## Readiness Criteria\n   116\t\n   117\t**These are technical quality gates, not customer validation targets.**\n   118\t\n   119\tExternal customers before v1.0 are not the success metric. The question is: **\"Is the system ready to run a real business (starting with Xentri itself)?\"**\n   120\t\n   121\t### v0.1 Readiness (Strategy Co-pilot + Brief)\n   122\t\n   123\t| Criterion | Gate | How We Know |\n   124\t|-----------|------|-------------|\n   125\t| **Brief completion works** | Pass/Fail | A user can go from sign-up to completed Brief in <15 minutes via conversation |\n   126\t| **Co-pilot conversation quality** | Qualitative | Conversation feels natural, not robotic. Follow-ups are relevant. Fallback to guided form works gracefully. |\n   127\t| **Brief schema is stable** | Pass/Fail | Schema supports all 7 sections (Identity, Audience, Offerings, Positioning, Operations, Goals, Proof). Versioning strategy defined. |\n   128\t| **Event Backbone logs reliably** | Pass/Fail | `brief_created`, `brief_updated` events fire correctly. Events are queryable. |\n   129\t| **Multi-tenancy is airtight** | Pass/Fail | Every query includes `org_id`. RLS enforced. No data leaks in testing. |\n   130\t| **Shell loads fast** | <2s on 3G | First meaningful paint under 2 seconds. |\n   131\t\n   132\t### v0.2 Readiness (Presencia: Website + CMS + Leads)\n   133\t\n   134\t| Criterion | Gate | How We Know |\n   135\t|-----------|------|-------------|\n   136\t| **Website publishes from Brief** | Pass/Fail | A user can generate a live website that pulls business name, services, positioning from their Brief |\n   137\t| **Custom domain works** | Pass/Fail | User can connect their own domain. SSL provisioned automatically. |\n   138\t| **Lead capture fires events** | Pass/Fail | `lead_created` event logged. Notification delivered (email + in-app). |\n   139\t| **CMS content is editable** | Pass/Fail | User can create/edit blog posts, service pages, portfolio items. |\n   140\t| **Brief → Website flow is seamless** | Qualitative | Content auto-populated from Brief feels right, not robotic. User can override. |\n   141\t| **Xentri runs on Xentri** | Pass/Fail | Xentri's own public site, content, and lead capture are powered by v0.2. |\n   142\t\n   143\t### Orchestration Readiness (Cross-Cutting)\n   144\t\n   145\t| Criterion | Gate | How We Know |\n   146\t|-----------|------|-------------|\n   147\t| **Events flow across modules** | Pass/Fail | `brief_updated` can trigger website content refresh prompt. `lead_created` appears in unified timeline. |\n   148\t| **Brief is live source of truth** | Pass/Fail | Changing Brief updates downstream consumers (website pulls new business name). |\n   149\t| **Shell navigation is stable** | Pass/Fail | Switching between Strategy and Brand categories feels like changing panels, not loading new apps. |\n   150\t\n   151\t---\n   152\t\n   153\t## Key Risks\n   154\t\n   155\t### Critical Risks (Must Mitigate)\n   156\t\n   157\t| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |\n   158\t|------|----------|------------|\n   159\t| **AI quality dependency** | Critical | The entire \"clarity-first\" differentiation depends on the Strategy Co-pilot being *good*. If conversations feel clunky or outputs are generic, positioning collapses. **Mitigation:** Graceful fallback to guided forms. Constrained scope (produce Brief, not run the business). Logged proposals for iteration. Quality benchmarks before launch. |\n   160\t| **Architectural foundation failure** | Critical | Event Backbone and Brief schema are load-bearing. Getting them wrong creates compounding debt. **Mitigation:** Foundation is a gated milestone. No feature work until Event Backbone is proven. Schema versioning strategy defined upfront. |\n   161\t| **Multi-tenant data leak** | Critical | One leak = catastrophic trust loss. **Mitigation:** RLS enforced in Postgres. Every query includes `org_id`. Paranoid testing. Code review checklist. |\n   162\t\n   163\t### High Risks (Active Monitoring)\n   164\t\n   165\t| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |\n   166\t|------|----------|------------|\n   167\t| **Wix/Squarespace adds clarity AI** | High | If incumbents copy \"conversation-first onboarding,\" we lose differentiation. **Mitigation:** Orchestration is the moat, not the entry point. Brief → everything is hard to replicate. Move fast. |\n   168\t| **Co-pilot hallucination** | High | AI generates plausible but wrong content. **Mitigation:** Scaffolding only—AI proposes, user confirms. No auto-publish. All proposals logged. |\n   169\t| **Scope creep on Website Builder** | Medium-High | Website builders are infinite scope sinks. **Mitigation:** Evaluate GrapesJS/Craft.js instead of building from scratch. Launch with 3-4 quality templates, not infinite customization. |\n   170\t\n   171\t### Accepted Risks (Proceed Anyway)\n   172\t\n   173\t| Risk | Severity | Rationale |\n   174\t|------|----------|-----------|\n   175\t| **No external customers until v1.0** | Accepted | Client Zero validation is sufficient. External customers are bonus. |\n   176\t| **PWA instead of native mobile** | Accepted | PWA is sufficient for MVP. Native can come later if needed. |\n   177\t| **No CFDI/SII compliance** | Accepted | Deferred to v0.4+.
