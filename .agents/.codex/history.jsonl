In Other words:\n\n# Unison – Brand Guidelines (v0.1)\n\n> Working name: **Unison**  \n> These guidelines describe the brand foundations for the Business OS project.  \n> If the project is renamed later, treat \"Unison\" as a placeholder and update accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Brand Core\n\n### 1.1 One-Liner\n\n> **Unison is the operating system for small businesses and agencies, unifying CRM, ERP, billing, and AI automations into one calm, native-feeling workspace.**\n\n### 1.2 Elevator Pitch\n\nMost small businesses run on a mess of tools: spreadsheets, WhatsApp, CRM, invoicing apps, manual reminders.\n\nUnison replaces that chaos with a single operating system:\n\n- A unified **app shell** that feels like a native desktop app.\n- Modular **apps** for CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots.\n- An invisible **event system** that keeps everything in sync across the business.\n\nResult: Teams work in one place, on one source of truth, at a sustainable rhythm.\n\n### 1.3 Brand Promise\n\n> **\"Bring your business tools into unison, and run everything from one place.\"**\n\n### 1.4 Brand Pillars\n\n1. **Unity** – One shell, one data model, one workspace.\n2. **Calm Control** – Clear dashboards, predictable systems, no drama.\n3. **Visible Automation** – Bots and workflows that explain what they did and why.\n4. **Real-World Ready** – Handles invoices, ledgers, permissions, and multi-tenant reality.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Brand Personality\n\nIf Unison were a person, it would be:\n\n- **Analytical but human** – understands workflows and numbers, but speaks plainly.\n- **Calm and composed** – no hype, no panic, just steady progress.\n- **Quietly powerful** – does heavy lifting behind the scenes, without showing off.\n- **Trustworthy and transparent** – automation is explainable, not magic.\n\nAvoid personalities like:\n\n- The loud “growth hacker” promising to 10x everything overnight.\n- The jargon-heavy consultant who hides simple ideas behind complex language.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Voice & Tone\n\n### 3.1 Principles\n\n1. **Plain, clear English**  \n   - Write for busy operators and owners.\n   - Short sentences. Concrete nouns. Few buzzwords.\n\n2. **Confident, not arrogant**  \n   - We know what we’re doing, but we don’t promise miracles.\n   - Say: “Unison reduces errors and copy-paste work,” not “eliminates all problems forever.”\n\n3. **Calm and reassuring**  \n   - Focus on stability, consistency, and clarity.\n   - Avoid fear tactics and fake urgency.\n\n4. **Localization-friendly**  \n   - Use language that will translate cleanly later.\n   - Avoid idioms and jokes that only make sense in one culture.\n\n### 3.2 Writing Examples\n\n**Good (homepage hero):**\n\n> Run your business from one workspace.  \n> Unison connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots so your team always works in sync.\n\n**Bad (too hype):**\n\n> Smash chaos with our AI super-suite and 10x your growth in a week!\n\n**Good (feature explanation):**\n\n> When a deal is marked as won, Unison can create the project, schedule tasks, and issue the invoice.  \n> You can see every step in the automation log.\n\n**Bad (too vague / magical):**\n\n> Our AI takes care of everything behind the scenes. Just sit back and relax.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Visual Identity (v0.1)\n\nThese are starting points for design; they will evolve with real UI work.\n\n### 4.1 Color Direction\n\nConcept: **Orchestrated calm.**\n\n- **Base:** Deep neutral (charcoal / ink) for backgrounds or major chrome.\n- **Primary accent:** A modern blue or teal that suggests clarity and flow.\n- **Secondary accents:** Soft gradients or subtle secondary colors for CRM vs ERP vs Bots.\n\nUsage:\n\n- Use color to signal **state** (success, warning, error) and **hierarchy**, not decoration.\n- Each core module can lean on a slightly different accent shade while keeping the overall look cohesive.\n\n### 4.2 Typography\n\nGoals:\n\n- Highly legible for tables, metrics, and forms.\n- Works across many locales and screen sizes.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- **Headings:** Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar).\n- **Body text:** Same family, regular weight, 14–16px for readability.\n\nRules:\n\n- Keep titles short and scannable.\n- Avoid over-styling; let whitespace and hierarchy do most of the work.\n\n### 4.3 Iconography & Illustration\n\n- Icons should be simple and consistent, ideally line-based or minimal solid icons.\n- Avoid cartoon mascots and over-cute elements.\n- If using illustrations, prefer abstract representations of flows, nodes, or grids rather than generic “businesspeople with laptops.”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Product UX Principles\n\n1. **One Shell, Many Apps**  \n   - The sidebar and header are stable anchors across CRM, ERP, Billing, and Bots.\n   - Switching between modules should feel like changing panels, not switching websites.\n\n2. **Keep Context With the User**  \n   - From any client record, you should be able to see related deals, invoices, tasks, and automations without opening five tabs.\n\n3. **Explain Automations**  \n   - Every automated action (sending an invoice, updating a status, posting a message) should be visible and traceable.\n   - Provide an “automation log” or similar view.\n\n4. **Multi-Tenant Safety by Design**  \n   - Make organization boundaries obvious.\n   - Never make it easy to confuse data between orgs or clients.\n\n5. **Design for Everyday Use, Not Demos**  \n   - Optimize for the daily workflows of small agencies and businesses:\n     - Lead → quote → project → invoice → payment.\n   - Fancy dashboards are secondary to clean, efficient flows.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Naming System (Modules & Sub-Brands)\n\nAssuming **Unison** as master brand:\n\n- **Platform:** Unison OS\n- **Modules:**\n  - **Unison CRM** – Leads, pipelines, activities, deals.\n  - **Unison ERP** – Invoices, ledgers, inventory, suppliers.\n  - **Unison Billing** – Subscriptions, one-off invoices, payment status.\n  - **Unison Bots** – AI assistants, chatbots, workflow automations.\n  - **Unison Core** – Auth, organizations, users, plans, multi-tenancy.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n- Use full module names in documentation and marketing.\n- Inside the app, you can shorten to **CRM**, **ERP**, **Billing**, **Bots**, **Core** once users are oriented.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Example Taglines & Messaging\n\nShort taglines:\n\n- “Bring your business tools into unison.”\n- “One operating system for your whole business.”\n- “From lead to invoice, in one flow.”\n\nHomepage hero example:\n\n> **Run your business in unison.**  \n> Unison OS connects your CRM, ERP, billing, and AI bots in a single workspace, so your team always works from the same source of truth.\n\nSubheading example:\n\n> No more switching apps or copying data by hand.  \n> See every client, project, and invoice in one place, with automations you can trust and understand.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Out of Scope (What Unison Is Not)\n\n- Not a generic task or note-taking app.\n- Not a “growth hack” dashboard.\n- Not just an integration layer that tapes together other tools.\n- Not limited to one country or language; English-first, translation-ready.\n\nUnison is built as **infrastructure for small businesses and agencies**: multi-tenant, schema-based, event-driven.  \nThe brand should feel as solid and coherent as the architecture."}

Concretely:\n\n   - Persona 1 – Owner / Founder\n     Change the \"Gains\" block to something like:\n       - One calm workspace that shows the real state of the business at a glance.\n       - Xentri’s AI operations brain keeps the core flows (lead → quote → project → invoice → payment) moving automatically, and surfaces what needs their attention today.\n       - Confidence that things keep moving even when they are offline or travelling.\n\n   - Persona 2 – Operations / General Manager\n     Change the \"Gains\" block to something like:\n       - One OS where end-to-end flows are modeled explicitly and can be improved centrally instead of in ten tools.\n       - An automation log that shows what Xentri (AI + workflows) did, when, and why, so debugging is transparent.\n       - Xentri takes over the routine routing, updates and reconciliations, so ops can focus on designing and improving processes instead of being the human glue.\n\n   - Persona 3 – Client-Facing Lead\n     Change the \"Gains\" block to something like:\n       - One client view with conversations, deals, projects, invoices and automations in a single place.\n       - An AI assistant in Xentri that tells them “what’s next” for each client and each day, so follow-ups and invoicing don’t depend on their memory.\n       - Confidence that important steps won’t fall through the cracks, even when they’re context switching.\n\nApply 1.7 with those adjustments; the rest of the personas’ structure (Thinks/Feels/Sees/Says/Does/Pains) can stay as-is."}
